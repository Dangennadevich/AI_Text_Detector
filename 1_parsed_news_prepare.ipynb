      "Статя 0:  Newsletter His executive order curbing asylum aligned him with a broad swath of the public in an election year. President Biden’s decision this week to seal the border temporarily to most asylum seekers was a striking policy shift. It sharply divided his party, invited comparisons to policies backed by former President Donald Trump and made him the owner of the most restrictive immigration measure ever to be carried out by a modern Democratic president. It also aligned him with a broad swath of the public on a key issue in an election year. A confluence of hyperbolic rhetoric from Republicans, led by Trump, and a surge in illegal border crossings in recent years has pushed immigration and border security to the forefront of the nation’s election-year psyche, turning immigration into a top concern for voters on both sides of the partisan divide — and a major liability for the president. Biden’s executive order, which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, is expected to be the subject of lawsuits that could result in courts halting it. But he and his allies believe the order will help them politically anyway, by allowing them to portray him as willing to take steps that Trump personally blocked earlier this year. In doing so, they hope to neutralize an issue that the former president has made a major focus of his campaign. “If you’re a good elected official or a politician, you’re going to listen to what the people are saying, and this is what the people are talking about,” said Representative Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, who won his House seat in a narrowly divided district on Long Island in part by campaigning on the very same topic, and who was among the officials who joined Biden at the White House for the announcement. “It’s part of the overall effort to not just neutralize but to show the Republicans for their hypocrisy.” When Biden ran for president, he said he wanted to restore the nation’s “historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers.” His tone was different on Tuesday. “The simple truth is there is a worldwide migrant crisis, and if the United States doesn’t secure our border, there is no limit to the number of people who may try to come here,” Biden said at the White House. \n",
      "Статя 1:  U.S. Immigration The new time constraint comes after President Biden announced a near-total ban on asylum on the southern border. Migrants who want protection in the United States are now facing another hurdle, even after President Biden announced a near-total ban on asylum. Starting on Wednesday, migrants who cross into the United States illegally have four hours to find a lawyer if they want to argue that they should be an exception to the sweeping restrictions on asylum that Mr. Biden announced on Tuesday. If they cannot find a lawyer, they have to make a credible case on their own or be turned back immediately. Migrants previously had at least 24 hours or more to find a lawyer. The tighter time constraint was laid out in an email from John Lafferty, the head of asylum at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, to the officers who are carrying out Mr. Biden’s executive action, which temporarily shut down asylum requests at the border. Despite Mr. Biden’s order, there are still some limited ways for migrants to enter the country. People who legitimately fear being tortured or persecuted in their home country can still seek protection in America using programs other than asylum, but those programs have a much higher bar for eligibility. Critics say the four-hour time limit could make it all but impossible to clear that bar. “Migrants who may have been exposed to severe trauma in the days before their encounter with U.S. officials should not be immediately forced into what could be the most important interview of their life without getting a meaningful chance to rest, or get any help,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, the policy director at the American Immigration Council. \n",
      "Статя 2:  As the prosecutor waved the silver Apple MacBook Pro, the jury gazed at it as if expecting sparks to fly from it. Reporting from Wilmington, Del. On a day dominated by lurid tales of Hunter Biden’s years as a crack addict, told by the defendant’s former wife as well as an ex-girlfriend, a brief sighting in the courtroom of a major headliner passed with almost no comment. At about 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, a federal prosecutor, Derek Hines, brandished the headliner in question — Mr. Biden’s notorious laptop, a silver Apple MacBook Pro encased in a plastic cover. He waggled it about with his left hand while reminding a government witness, Erika Jensen, an F.B.I. special agent, of all the data that had been seized during the Department of Justice’s investigation of Mr. Biden. The jurors and courtroom spectators gazed at government Exhibit 16 as if expecting sparks to fly from it. Three seconds later, Mr. Hines returned the laptop to the prosecutors’ table, soon to be buried under a heap of other government evidence. It received no further mention. The laptop’s cameo appearance, after making a similarly brief appearance the day before, underscored how anticlimactic its role has been in the various investigations relating to the conduct of what right-wing critics term “the Biden crime family.” House Republicans failed to glean from its contents anything warranting impeachment of President Biden, the defendant’s father. Nothing has yet emerged from it that ties the son to criminal activity other than drug-related misadventures to which the younger Mr. Biden has already confessed. The government’s case against Mr. Biden, who has been charged with illegally purchasing a gun, centers on whether he lied on a federal firearms application when he said he was not abusing drugs. \n",
      "Статя 3:  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, criticized the Biden administration for denying him Secret Service protection. On the 56th anniversary of his father’s assassination, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, again pleaded on Wednesday to be granted Secret Service protection, arguing in an interview on Fox News that he was at an elevated risk of being targeted because of his family history. “I was with my dad when he died in Los Angeles in 1968,” said Mr. Kennedy, who was 14 at the time of the shooting. He then asserted that the White House “is involved in this decision” to deny his requests for Secret Service protection and argued that his campaign was significant enough to deserve that protection. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment. Mr. Kennedy has made requests for Secret Service protection for more than a year, predating his independent candidacy. Last July, when he was still running against President Biden in the Democratic primaries, he said a request for a Secret Service detail had been denied by Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, who has the authority to approve those requests. Mr. Kennedy has since repeatedly made the request, circulating an online petition in support of it, and has been denied each time. In his interview on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy pointed to several incidents that demonstrated his need for additional security, including break-ins at his home in California and an episode in September in which an armed man was arrested at a campaign event and charged with gun crimes after he tried to meet Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Mayorkas has previously said that he has declined Mr. Kennedy’s requests at the recommendation of a panel of top congressional leaders. “It is ultimately my decision, but I have followed their recommendation each time,” he said in May. Mr. Mayorkas can consider several factors in determining who should receive protection, and those criteria give preferential treatment to major-party candidates. Before Nikki Haley ended her Republican presidential campaign, the congressional panel recommended that she receive Secret Service protection, in part for her strength in national polling. The Secret Service also notes that “some candidates have received protection earlier in the campaign pursuant to presidential memoranda.” \n",

Photographs by Erin Schaff Reporting from Goldfield, Nev. Cindy Elgan glanced into the lobby of her office and saw a sheriff’s deputy waiting at the front counter. “Let’s start a video recording, just in case this goes sideways,” Elgan, 65, told one of her employees in the Esmeralda County clerk’s office. She had come to expect skepticism, conspiracy theories and even threats related to her job as an election administrator. She grabbed her annotated booklet of Nevada state laws, said a prayer for patience and walked into the lobby to confront the latest challenge to America’s electoral process. The deputy was standing alongside a woman that Elgan recognized as Mary Jane Zakas, 77, a longtime elementary schoolteacher and a leader in the local Republican Party. She often asked for a sheriff’s deputy to accompany her to the election’s office, in case her meetings became contentious. “Hi, Mary Jane. What can I do for you today?” Elgan asked, as she slid a bowl of candy across the counter. “I hope you’re having a blessed morning,” Zakas said. “Unfortunately, a lot of people are still very concerned about the security of their votes. They’ve lost all trust in the system.” “I’d be happy to answer any questions and explain our process again,” Elgan said. “We’re beyond that,” Zakas said. She reached into her purse and set a notarized form on the counter. Elgan recognized it as a recall petition, a collection of signatures from voters who wanted to remove an elected official from office. It had been more than 20 years since the county’s last successful recall, and Elgan leaned down to study the form. \n",
      "Статя 5:  Conversations with nearly 2,000 voters showed a small number had changed their minds about Donald J. Trump. Here’s what a few said about why. By Reid J. Epstein and Camille Baker By the time former President Donald J. Trump was convicted last week on 34 felony counts, the vast majority of people had made up their minds about him. But a small sliver of Trump-ambivalent voters is out there — and in a close presidential election, they matter a lot. For days, The New York Times has been listening to those voters process the news of Mr. Trump’s conviction, trying to measure the small shifts that could alter the contest between him and President Biden. Will Trump-leaning voters move firmly into his camp? Will Biden-leaning voters get off the fence? A New York Times/Siena College Poll study of nearly 2,000 voters found modest good news for Mr. Biden. While the vast majority of people had not changed their position on the two men, more voters moved away from Mr. Trump than toward him.  Follow-up interviews with these post-verdict switchers offer a window into the minds of still-persuadable Americans. Despite the big events and dramatic headlines, these voters said they were generally not fans of either candidate, they were in no hurry to decide and they might not vote at all. Here’s a look at how this small, but potentially crucial, group of voters is thinking about Mr. Trump’s conviction and how it might affect their choice for president in November: Mr. Lyons, 65, owns catering and welding companies and a boat storage facility. Earlier this year, he said he considered himself a Trump voter primarily because of his anger over Mr. Biden’s economic policies — even though he said he opposed Republican attempts to limit abortion rights. \n",
      "Статя 6:  Donald Trump attended a fund-raiser in San Francisco, and his host, the tech entrepreneur David Sacks, hoped to portray Silicon Valley as a more MAGA-welcoming place. One March night in the nation’s capital, Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, left a conservative gala to join a group having dinner with Donald Trump Jr. As the meal wrapped, Mr. Vance decided, on a whim, to invite a friend, whom he had just introduced at the gala dinner, to meet the former president’s son. Soon, the three Republicans — Mr. Vance, Mr. Trump Jr. and Mr. Vance’s friend, David Sacks, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur — were getting to know one another for a half-hour or so in a private dining room of the Conrad Hotel. It was there, at that impromptu post-dinner hang hours after Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, that Mr. Sacks signaled that he was all-in for Trump 2024. On Thursday evening, this time on his own California turf, it was Mr. Sacks’s turn to host Team Trump. The former president himself flew to San Francisco to attend a fund-raiser at Mr. Sacks’s $20 million home on the toniest street in the city’s tony Pacific Heights neighborhood. The private event, the first campaign fund-raiser since Mr. Trump’s criminal conviction last week, was expected to raise north of $12 million, according to people involved in the gathering. Beyond the money, the fund-raiser in the beating heart of the liberal tech industry was also in some ways a landmark event, at least symbolically. Four years ago, and certainly eight years ago, the Bay Area remained a haven for liberalism and offered little support for Mr. Trump. But that Obama-era bonhomie between Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party has come close to disintegrating.

      "Статя 7:  The $14 million effort by Mr. Scott’s super PAC comes as the South Carolina senator is said to be high on Donald Trump’s list of potential running mates. By Michael C. Bender Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, views former President Donald J. Trump’s 34 felony convictions as politically positive for his party — and a circumstance that will help increase Black and Hispanic support in November. “The decision last week is actually helpful to driving more folks to the Republican Party,” Mr. Scott told reporters, adding that the convictions would help conservatives win over Black men who “are so fed up with this two-tiered justice system.” Mr. Scott announced a $14 million plan led by his super PAC to help persuade Black and Hispanic voters to support Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates. In his announcement, Mr. Scott portrayed himself as one of the best spokesmen to achieve a goal that has long proved difficult for the Republican Party. But it also appeared aimed at communicating with one man in particular, Mr. Trump, for whom Mr. Scott is a potential running mate. The former president, who has prioritized his campaign’s courtship of Black voters, is said to be considering potential vice presidents who can, among other things, help his campaign raise money and offer it some political upside. Mr. Scott said he was positioned to help Mr. Trump and other Republicans win more Black and Hispanic voters because of the role he has played as a South Carolina senator, including in increasing funding for historically Black colleges and universities and backing new criminal justice laws aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners and expanding early-release programs. \n",
      "Статя 8:  Locked in a hotly contested primary against George Latimer, Mr. Bowman got a lifeline from Ms. Warren, a progressive senator from Massachusetts. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts waded into one of the nation’s most contentious House primaries on Thursday, extending a lifeline to an endangered ally on the left, Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York. Ms. Warren, a national liberal standard-bearer, has supported Mr. Bowman since his first run in 2020. But his campaign is hoping her renewed endorsement will help the congressman reassure a bloc of highly educated white liberals that he needs to save his seat from a well-financed Democratic challenger. In a statement to The New York Times, Ms. Warren said that Mr. Bowman had been singled out by “corporate interests” because of his support for ambitious left-leaning policy programs like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Though she did not mention the war in Gaza, her remark appeared to be a veiled reference to a super PAC dedicated to advancing Israel’s interests in the American politics. The group has made Mr. Bowman, a vocal critic of the nation’s war effort, a top target and has already spent more than $10 million trying to defeat him. “Together, we’ve worked with President Biden to protect renters and have plans to lower housing costs,” Ms. Warren said. “I look forward to continued partnership, shoulder-to-shoulder, to stand up to MAGA extremists and deliver for working families.” The senator was the latest high-profile lawmaker to take sides ahead of the June 25 primary between Mr. Bowman and George Latimer, the Westchester County executive. Mr. Bowman, a second-term congressman, has largely secured the support of his party’s left wing, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and advocacy organizations like Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Mr. Latimer, a mainstream Democrat, has drawn strong support from New York’s more moderate political establishment. Mr. Latimer did win over a former liberal ally of Mr. Bowman’s earlier this week. Mondaire Jones, a former congressman running to reclaim a neighboring House seat, told The New York Times that the tenor of Mr. Bowman’s criticisms of Israel since Oct. 7 had caused a “long, painful nightmare” for the district.

For his campaign, it is another opportunity to whack former President Donald J. Trump.

      "Статя 0:  Newsletter His executive order curbing asylum aligned him with a broad swath of the public in an election year. President Biden’s decision this week to seal the border temporarily to most asylum seekers was a striking policy shift. It sharply divided his party, invited comparisons to policies backed by former President Donald Trump and made him the owner of the most restrictive immigration measure ever to be carried out by a modern Democratic president. It also aligned him with a broad swath of the public on a key issue in an election year. A confluence of hyperbolic rhetoric from Republicans, led by Trump, and a surge in illegal border crossings in recent years has pushed immigration and border security to the forefront of the nation’s election-year psyche, turning immigration into a top concern for voters on both sides of the partisan divide — and a major liability for the president. Biden’s executive order, which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, is expected to be the subject of lawsuits that could result in courts halting it. But he and his allies believe the order will help them politically anyway, by allowing them to portray him as willing to take steps that Trump personally blocked earlier this year. In doing so, they hope to neutralize an issue that the former president has made a major focus of his campaign. “If you’re a good elected official or a politician, you’re going to listen to what the people are saying, and this is what the people are talking about,” said Representative Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, who won his House seat in a narrowly divided district on Long Island in part by campaigning on the very same topic, and who was among the officials who joined Biden at the White House for the announcement. “It’s part of the overall effort to not just neutralize but to show the Republicans for their hypocrisy.” When Biden ran for president, he said he wanted to restore the nation’s “historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers.” His tone was different on Tuesday. “The simple truth is there is a worldwide migrant crisis, and if the United States doesn’t secure our border, there is no limit to the number of people who may try to come here,” Biden said at the White House. \n",
      "Статя 1:  U.S. Immigration The new time constraint comes after President Biden announced a near-total ban on asylum on the southern border. Migrants who want protection in the United States are now facing another hurdle, even after President Biden announced a near-total ban on asylum. Starting on Wednesday, migrants who cross into the United States illegally have four hours to find a lawyer if they want to argue that they should be an exception to the sweeping restrictions on asylum that Mr. Biden announced on Tuesday. If they cannot find a lawyer, they have to make a credible case on their own or be turned back immediately. Migrants previously had at least 24 hours or more to find a lawyer. The tighter time constraint was laid out in an email from John Lafferty, the head of asylum at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, to the officers who are carrying out Mr. Biden’s executive action, which temporarily shut down asylum requests at the border. Despite Mr. Biden’s order, there are still some limited ways for migrants to enter the country. People who legitimately fear being tortured or persecuted in their home country can still seek protection in America using programs other than asylum, but those programs have a much higher bar for eligibility. Critics say the four-hour time limit could make it all but impossible to clear that bar. “Migrants who may have been exposed to severe trauma in the days before their encounter with U.S. officials should not be immediately forced into what could be the most important interview of their life without getting a meaningful chance to rest, or get any help,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, the policy director at the American Immigration Council. \n",

      "['Conservatives fighting to stem loss of high-value donors to Reform UK', 'The Conservatives are fighting back in an attempt to stem the loss of high-value donors amid a shift in funders towards Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party.\\nThe party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, is expected to appear at the Conservatives’ London conference in Westminster on Saturday, where wealthy party donors say they have been invited to evening drinks.\\nIt comes after Reform’s fundraiser in Mayfair on Tuesday which was attended by former Conservative donors including Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi, who each paid £25,000 to join a top table with Farage.\\nSources in Reform say that pledges of more than £1m had already come in from businesspeople, and the Guardian understands there is now deep concern at Conservative central headquarters (CCHQ) that many of their donors are considering switching to Farage’s party.\\nOne Conservative source said the past few months appeared to be one of the worst periods ever for the party in terms of bringing in donations.\\nThey said the CCHQ’s treasurer department was extremely concerned about the number of donors who have paused or entirely stopped donations. There is particular worry about those who have already started contributing to Reform, as it can be almost impossible to bring back donors who switch to another party.\\nOthers senior Conservatives are alarmed that Badenoch does not appear to have put in enough effort to wooing donors, with one attender at a function saying she turned up late, was not explicit enough about asking for money and then left early.\\nThere is even concern among some of Badenoch’s high profile supporters.\\nSir Rocco Forte, the luxury hotel owner who gave £20,000 to Badenoch’s leadership campaign last year and donated £100,000 to the Tory party during its successful 2019 general election campaign, said: “It’s not yet clear what the Conservative party is doing and for me and many other people there is a big question mark.\\n“I’m a very big supporter of Kemi Badenoch. I think she understands a radical revolution is needed. A lot of what Reform is saying is pointing in the right direction and I admire Farage, who have momentum at the moment and have no baggage.\\n“The problem for Kemi Badenoch is that every time she says anything, others ask ‘Well, why didn’t you do something about it when you’re in power?’ I think she’s got to disassociate herself quite significantly from what happened in the last 14 years when there was a strategy of the middle ground and all that.”\\nHe said he thought Farage could reach parts of the country the Tories could not, “particularly the north”, adding: “It could well be that come the next election you could have the vote on the right split. Some form of accommodation may have to come about. People talk about a merger but I think an accommodation is more likely.”\\nIn an uncomfortable moment for Badenoch, Farage plans to park Reform’s tanks on the Tory leader’s own lawn on Friday night by holding a rally in her constituency of North West Essex.\\nBadenoch is defending a relatively slim majority of 2,610 in what was once a Tory stronghold, but where a bigger Reform showing at the next election could hand the seat to Labour by splitting the right-wing vote.\\nThe Conservative leader has retained Graham Edwards as treasurer of the party, a role the property tycoon has held since he was appointed by Rishi Sunak in 2022. Edwards, who donated £12,000 to Badenoch’s leadership campaign, runs Telereal Trillium, one of the UK’s largest property firms. He has contributed £3.5m to the party since 2018, including a £2m donation last year.\\nHowever, some donors feel that the party has not adequately found a replacement for Ben Elliot, the Old Etonian who supercharged donations under Boris Johnson by targeting the world’s ultra-wealthy, raising more than £70m in two-and-a-half years after being appointed co-chair and fundraiser before the 2019 general election.\\n“Ben Elliot did quite a good job,” said Forte. “Treasurers have to be prepared to upset people by asking them. I’ve known treasurers who’ve been afraid to ask me for money. You’ve got to ask me for money if you want me to give it.”\\nA Conservative party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives are under new leadership and are working to renew and rebuild the trust of the British people. Fundraising is an important part of the democratic process and the Conservative party holds regular events around the country.”']\n",

      "['‘Gove saw the polls and realised he might lose’: Lib Dems hope to knock down Tory ‘blue wall’ in Surrey', 'Shortly after Rishi Sunak got drenched in a downpour in Downing Street to call a surprise general election, a missive was sent out to party supporters in a key Surrey constituency to rally support.\\nCampaigners were urged to “safeguard the future” of the leafy Surrey Heath seat in the commuter belt and be “fully dedicated to making sure Michael Gove is re-elected”.\\nIt was an inspiring call to arms, but not everyone was on board. Two days after a soggy Sunak announced the election, Gove said he would not in fact be standing again.\\nThe Surrey Heath Conservative Association has been wrongfooted by the pace of political events and is yet to announce its candidate.\\nWhen the door of its offices in the village of Windlesham was buzzed by the Observer on Friday, the window blinds were drawn and the local party agent only briefly appeared with a curt: “No comment.”\\nThe Liberal Democrats, who took control of the local council last year, are now relishing a battle to try to seize what was once one of the safest Conservative seats in the country.\\nTheir ambition is to build a “yellow wedge” of seats from south-west London into the heart of the home counties.\\nSpeaking at the local party’s campaign headquarters in an office block next to Camberley railway station, Alasdair Pinkerton, an academic and the Lib Dem candidate, said the seat’s Tory campaigners had been “left in the lurch” by Gove’s decision.\\nHe added: “Gove was never built for opposition and I also think he saw the polls and realised that it was going to be incredibly tight and he might lose.”\\nDespite needing to overturn a majority of more than 18,300 votes, Pinkerton considers the seat is “absolutely winnable”. He believes swathes of lifelong Tory voters are turning their back on the party.\\n“There has been a whole series of tipping points,” he said. “For some people it was Boris [Johnson] partying during lockdown and for others it was the PPE [personal protective equipment] contracts.\\n“It’s been like dominoes, with people falling at slightly different times. Some will never go back. Many have come over to us. Not everybody, but a very large number.”\\nBob Pritchard, 76, who lives in Camberley, the biggest town in the constituency, is among the once loyal Tory supporters who now describe themselves as “floating voters”. He said that he considered Boris Johnson had been “embarrassing” as a prime minister and described Liz Truss as a “disaster”.\\n“Politics and this country are not in a good place,” he said. “There needs to be change.”\\nPritchard said he was moving away from the Tories, but was not impressed by Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, who was pictured last week falling from a paddleboard on Windermere and racing down a children’s waterslide in a rubber ring. Pritchard said: “I think the antics he gets up to are not conducive to being leader of a party.”\\nRetired couple Terry and Caroline Wiseman, who were among the householders being canvassed by the Lib Dem team last week, are also ex-Tory supporters now looking to cast their votes elsewhere.\\nTerry, 68, a former commercial manager, said: “I have voted Tory since I was 18, but I won’t be voting Tory this time. Liz Truss was the final straw.” The couple are still undecided on which candidate will get their vote.\\nTerry Emment, 61, who has a fruit and vegetable stall in Camberley town centre, is also among the undecided voters. He said: “I have voted Tory all my life. It’s now time for a change. I voted for Brexit, but the consequences have been horrendous for my business.”\\nHe said leaving the single market meant he was now paying a “surcharge” of £60 on each pallet of imported produce.\\nDainah Wanjiru, 43, a care worker, who was walking in the town centre with her four children, said she wanted a new government to invest more in social care. She said: “Life is hard as a carer and trying to pay the bills is very difficult,” she said.\\nOn the doorstep, the key issues are the cost of living crisis, the NHS and sewage discharges into the country’s rivers by the water companies.\\nIn February and March last year, raw sewage sludge was imported to Thames Water’s sewage treatment works in Camberley, permeating the community with a foul stench over the summer months.\\nInteractive  It later emerged that more than 200 tankers of raw sewage had been transported to the town after all of Thames Water’s treatment plants reached critical capacity. The company apologised, but said it was faced with the choice of storing it in tanks in the town or discharging it into rivers, causing massive pollution.\\nAnother key local issue is the previous decision by the formerly Tory-controlled Surrey Heath council to borrow funds to buy a House of Fraser building in Camberley town centre and the shopping centre for £113m in 2016. The developments are now thought to be worth 70% less than the purchase price.\\nPinkerton fought Surrey Heath in the last election, achieving a 16.4% swing to the Lib Dems, and while Gove still won with a majority of 18,349, Surrey Heath is now on the party’s target list of Tory “blue wall” seats. In the last election, Labour trailed third, with just 5,407 votes.\\nClive Watson, 63, the pub entrepreneur and co-founder of the City Pub Group, who lives in village of Pirbright in the constituency, has previously campaigned for the Tories, but switched his support to the Lib Dems after the vote for Brexit.\\nWatson believes the Tories may lose Surrey Heath. “There are a lot of former Conservatives who are now shy Liberal Democrats,” he said. “People are disillusioned with the Conservatives.”']\n",

      "['Labour ‘throwing the kitchen sink’ at Selby byelection as hopes grow of shock win', 'Labour is “throwing the kitchen sink” at claiming the Conservative stronghold of Selby and Ainsty, amid growing optimism that it can pull off a shock win that would show its progress in Tory-held rural seats.\\nThe North Yorkshire constituency, which was recently vacated by Boris Johnson ally Nigel Adams, returned a majority of more than 20,000 for the Tories at the last election. Labour had been targeting a strong second place in the seat, to fend off claims that only the Liberal Democrats can take on the Tories in their heartlands.\\nHowever, while Labour officials believe the campaign will be defined over the final 10 days before polling day, early reports from the byelection campaign have raised hopes that the party has a chance of an unlikely win.\\nLabour is already expected to win another byelection in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the seat vacated by Johnson, where the majority at the last election was just 7,210 votes.\\nSenior officials have opted to provide resources for the Selby campaign on a similar footing to Uxbridge before the ballots on 20 July. A series of shadow cabinet ministers are being dispatched to the seat, including Rachel Reeves and Emily Thornberry in the last week.\\nThe news comes with figures around Keir Starmer frustrated by assumptions that the Lib Dems would be the biggest threat in Selby and other rural seats. Labour is also planning a full assault on Mid Bedfordshire, another largely rural seat that former culture secretary Nadine Dorries has promised to vacate. She has not yet formally resigned.\\nInsiders believe proving that Labour is making progress far outside its heartlands is a crucial step before next year’s general election. However, the degree to which hardened Tory voters opt not to turn out at the Selby byelection is seen as the potentially crucial factor in the outcome.\\n“It’s not a constituency we’ve ever held,” said a senior figure. “The seat as it’s constructed right now would never have been Labour in any kind of general election challenge. But it’s going well. Whether it’s going well enough to win, it’s just so hard to tell.\\n“We’re putting resources into both [Uxbridge and Selby] and we’re in a fortunate position where we can have good staff, MPs and organisers and activists into both. Our aim at the start in Selby was to show that we can give ourselves a chance to win the redrawn seat at the general election.\\n“But we also want to show in this campaign that Labour can win votes in rural parts of the country directly off the Tories. I think that’s what will happen in Selby - whether it’s enough or not, we’ll have to see. For us, it’s a sort of a no-lose situation. We can throw the kitchen sink at it.”\\nThe byelections now pose a huge problem for Rishi Sunak, who has seen Labour’s poll lead widen in recent weeks after initially improving his party’s standing in the wake of Liz Truss’s calamitous time in office. Sunak headed to the Selby and Ainsty seat today [SAT] as he attempts to see off Labour’s challenge. A recent poll suggested Labour had a 12-point lead in Selby, with 41% backing Labour’s Keir Mather and 29% supporting the Conservatives’ Claire Holmes. It would represent a swing of 24 points from the Tories to Labour if repeated on polling day.\\nMeanwhile, Labour officials have become nervous about the Uxbridge race after losing a local council byelection in Cambridge to the Conservatives last week. The campaign was dominated by a plan to introduce a congestion charge. The Tories have not had a councillor in Cambridge since 2012.\\nIn the last few days, Labour’s Uxbridge candidate, Danny Beales, has spoken out against London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to expand the capital’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to the constituency. The disagreement has been seized on by the Tories, who are effectively trying to turn the race into a single-issue contest. Beales said last week that it was “not the right time” to extend the Ulez scheme. His intervention appears to have been sanctioned by the leader’s office, which is desperate to secure the symbolism of winning Johnson’s former constituency.\\n“You can see that if you get the politics wrong, even if the polls are good, you can do very badly,” said one figure involved in the byelection campaigns.\\n“Both Selby and Uxbridge present different challenges – Uxbridge because of Ulez and Selby because of how many core Tory votes are out there and how rural the constituency is, which makes it very hard for us to cover in a short campaign.”']\n",

      "['Labour expects surge of ‘shy Reform’ voters in some northern and Midlands seats', 'Labour candidates and activists are privately braced for a surge in support for Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK in north-west England and the Midlands, with some forecasting a margin of fewer than 2,000 votes between the two parties in some seats in Thursday’s general election.\\nIn certain Conservative-held seats, campaigners told the Guardian that the Tories were likely to be pushed into third place by Reform, with one citing the phenomenon of “shy Reformers” affecting the results.\\nIn some more diverse constituencies, there has in effect been a double splintering of the vote, with a candidate on the left or campaigning on Gaza appealing particularly to BAME voters, coupled with growing Reform support among white voters who might have otherwise have been targeted as Conservative switchers to Labour.\\n“Our target voters are vulnerable,” one candidate said. “A last-minute issue could sway them to Reform.”\\nReform UK – whose central pitch is a crackdown on immigration, and several of whose candidates stand accused of making racist remarks – started the election campaign polling at about 11%, but after the surprise return of Farage as leader, support for the party rose to an average of 16% last week.\\nOne Labour organiser in the East Midlands said it was possible Reform could win a Labour-held seat in northern England or the Midlands. They said it was almost impossible to track the party’s support via their canvassing data and compared the phenomenon to 2015, when Labour had no way of measuring the scale of the vote for Reform’s predecessor party, Ukip. “I expect some shocks,” the activist said.\\nSeats where activists are understood to have raised concerns about Reform include two in Oldham, as well as Leigh and Atherton, and Makerfield. Other places where Reform is expected to perform well are Bolsover and Sherwood Forest, and in Barnsley.\\nA senior organiser in the Midlands said Labour would comfortably win their Tory-held seat but that Reform would “definitely come second”. They said they were concerned the Reform vote was higher than expected because of the high rate of postal vote returns. Those who vote by post are likely to be older and therefore skew to the right.\\n“Our postal vote turnout is 80%. That means that some of those former Tories are still voting – and I don’t think they are all voting Labour,” they said. “We’re holding back Tory attacks in the last day because we think it might shift people to Reform.”\\nThe organiser said they did not rule out a shock defeat for Labour in one or two seats, particularly those with a majority white population. “We have some very weak candidates in some places, especially where we are challenging Tories,” they said.\\nActivists said they had seen little evidence of an effective Reform ground campaign but that they suspected many of the undecided white voters they were encountering were breaking for Reform, especially where a local issue was at play, such as a hotel for asylum seekers or the imposition of electricity pylons.\\n“It’s specifically men breaking for Reform. Often we are getting women answering the door, they are voting Labour. In 2015, we had [a] 7,000 Ukip vote and they just didn’t say – they didn’t register on the canvass return.”\\nAnother campaigner said: “I think the imposition of Labour candidates has annoyed some local people. Most of these seats we will still win, but it’ll be too close for comfort and potentially less than 2,000 votes between us and second-placed Reform.”\\nLabour-held seats where a splintering of the vote was causing significant unpredictability include Debbie Abrahams’s and Jim McMahon’s seats in Oldham, as well as Bury North, where James Daly had the smallest majority in the country for the Conservatives.\\n“The polls may not pick up these ‘shy Reformers,’” one activist said. “Lots of the ‘don’t knows’ aren’t actually ‘don’t knows’ – they’re voting Reform but don’t want to admit it.”\\nMost candidates and activists still believe Labour is on course for a comfortable victory but say efforts will be made immediately to persuade senior Labour strategists of the need to devote significant attention to Reform come the next election.\\n“It has all the makings of a Ukip effect of taking votes off us and the Tories 50-50, making Farage more influential,” the activist said. “We seem to be sleepwalking towards it all, with lots not realising the huge shift that is about to happen in our politics.”']\n",

      "['Peter Bone saga shows Tories are weak, Labour tells Wellingborough voters', 'Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth has accused the Conservatives of being weak in their handling of the case of the disgraced former MP Peter Bone and said the prime minister is being “pushed around” by members of his party, as he campaigned in Wellingborough before an upcoming byelection.\\nAshworth, the MP for Leicester South and shadow paymaster general, was in the Northamptonshire seat after a byelection was triggered on Tuesday when 13% of the Wellingborough electorate signed a recall petition against Bone, who was found in October to have engaged in bullying and sexual misconduct against a former staff member.\\nAlthough Wellingborough has been considered a Conservative stronghold, Labour is eyeing up another byelection win there after a string of shock results in recent months. Bone won the seat in 2019 with a majority of more than 18,000.\\nAshworth said: “I do think there’s a yearning for change on the streets of Wellingborough, as there is across the country now. It’s just chaos. What we’ve seen in recent months is Rishi Sunak gets pushed around by these backbenchers, characters who think they are off playing mafiosos from a Godfather film. The public don’t want this ongoing psychodrama that we get with the Tory party now.”\\nLast week a number of factions on the right of the Conservative party, to which Bone belonged, were called “the five families”, a reference to mafia dynasties in New York.\\nThe Tories have yet to select a candidate to replace Bone – who was seen campaigning with a Conservative minister after his suspension from the party – and Ashworth said this showed the party had been weak in its handling of the situation.\\nLabour is pinning its hopes on its candidate Gen Kitchen, who grew up in Northamptonshire (although in the neighbouring seat) as the daughter of two Royal Navy personnel and now works in fundraising.\\n“People don’t have quite as much pride as they used to in the town centre. We’re a market town without market any more,” Kitchen said. “It’s making sure people know we’re responsible for the local community here and take it seriously.”\\nThree large estates around the edge of the town centre, originally built to accommodate overspill population from London, make up a large proportion of the population, which is among the 20% most deprived in the country.\\nThere was a strong sense of disillusionment among voters on the streets of Wellingborough as they reacted to news that Bone, their MP since 2005, had been ousted.\\nPaul Tustian, 72, who was one of the 13% of voters who signed the recall petition, said: “What has he done for Wellingborough town centre? Look at it. There’s a lot of broken promises. We’ve lost the market. We’ve lost everything here.”\\nHis wife, Sue, 79, said: “We’ve been here 22 years and I can’t even think of anything he’s done. Labour probably will win only because people are disappointed with Peter Bone and he was a Tory, so people aren’t going to vote Tory again in case we get the same as before. I don’t know if people will vote Labour, but they will vote to get rid of the Tories.”\\nPete Webb, 44, a trainee manager, described the town’s former MP as “like Marmite”. He said: “He was very assertive with his views. Some people might like him, he was very hard on Brexit and maybe that appeals to some but it didn’t appeal to me.\\n“It’s be interesting to  are not happy. We want complete change.”\\nThe government has been contacted for comment.']\n",

I know she’s got a very bad temper. I know she’s well known for lashing out at people, but I am not at all happy, and I’m going to take some action.”\\nBut a Tory source told Sky News: “[Farage] is clearly rattled that his Boxing Day publicity stunt is facing serious questions … Like most normal people around the UK, Kemi is enjoying Christmas with her family and looking forward to taking on the challenges of renewing the Conservative party in the new year.”\\nThe row appears to have further boosted Reform’s membership numbers with more than 143,000 people signed up, according to its website.

Today, this government has announced it’s abandoned our sovereignty of the archipelago, including the militarily essential Diego Garcia.”\\nThe former Tory prime minister Boris Johnson said it was “crazy” to give up control of the Chagos Islands. He told GB News: “Why are we doing this? Sheer political correctness, desire to look like the good guys, desire to look as though we’re unbundling the last relics of our empire.\\n“It’s nonsense. It’s a bad idea in hard geopolitical terms, because the base in Diego Garcia is of huge strategic importance for the US, for the west, and it’s a key component of the Anglo-American alliance. It’s one of the things we bring to the table, has been for decades.”\\nTruss’s spokesperson, however, blamed Johnson for the decision. “It was Boris Johnson who asked Liz to talk to [the Mauritius prime minister Pravind Jugnauth] about this at Cop26, which she did. But she was absolutely clear that we would and should never cede the territory.”\\nCleverly’s leadership rival Tom Tugendhat criticised his colleagues’ role in the process, saying it was “disgraceful that these negotiations started under our watch”.\\nJonathan Powell, Starmer’s special envoy for negotiations between the UK and Mauritius who brokered the deal, rejected the “silly” Tory criticism, noting Cleverly had “enthusiastically” led the talks not long ago.\\nWhen the prime minister was asked to guarantee that no other British overseas territories would be signed away under Labour, he told reporters: “The single most important thing was ensuring that we had a secure base, the joint US-UK base; hugely important to the US, hugely important to us.\\n“We’ve now secured that and that is why you saw such warm words from the US yesterday.”\\nThe agreement over the continued UK-US military presence on Diego Garcia is expected to run for 99 years with an option to renew, with Britain paying an annual sum of money.']\n",

At Labour’s campaign launch, he said: “I don’t think he’s ever believed that plan is going to work, and so he has called an election early enough to have it not tested before the election.”\\nThose opposing the scheme, including trade unions and refugee charities, celebrated the likelihood that the Rwanda plan would now probably not happen, with Labour the clear favourites to win the election.\\nSunak had previously agreed to a £1,000 bet with the broadcaster Piers Morgan that flights to Rwanda would take off before polling day, and the journalist is now demanding he pays up to a refugee charity.\\nAnother key plank of Sunak’s premiership, a promise to ban young people from ever being able to buy tobacco legally, was also left in doubt after it was not mentioned among the final business in the House of Commons before the election.\\nSunak had promised in his campaign launch that the “next generation will grow up smoke-free”. However, the leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, did not include the tobacco and vapes bill as she set out the legislation that could be rushed through by MPs before parliament is prorogued on Friday during a period known as “wash-up”. Sources said it was not possible to get through legislation that was subject to a free vote during that time.\\nThe government also appeared unlikely to pass Martyn’s law, the legislation to tighten venue security named in honour of one of the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing.\\nThe mother of Martyn Hett, one of the 22 victims of the attack, said she felt misled by Sunak after he had promised to rush through the bill in her son’s name before summer, hours before he called the general election.\\nFigen Murray met the prime minister at about 1pm on Wednesday, four hours before he announced the election, after walking 200 miles to Downing Street to mark the seventh anniversary of the terror atrocity.\\n“He promised me and we shook hands on it and he said he will definitely present the legislation in parliament before summer recess,” she said. “Obviously at that time he knew that he was going to call an election that day but we didn’t know that.\\n“Although what he said was good, what isn’t so good is that he can’t commit to it being totally done and dusted by the next election – and then later that day he called the election.”\\nLabour has indicated it would introduce the bill “as soon as possible”.\\nIt was Sunak’s acknowledgment that Rwanda flights would not leave before July that caused the most consternation in his own already divided party. Pressed on whether any deportation flights would take off before voters go to the polls, Sunak repeatedly said the scheme would get up and running only after the election. “If I am re-elected as prime minister on 5 July, these flights will go … we will get our Rwanda scheme up and running,” he told the BBC.\\nStarmer said Sunak’s move to an election before the scheme had started meant the prime minister knew that the plan, devised two years ago under Boris Johnson, would not work. “We have to deal with the terrible loss of control of the border under this government, we have to tackle the small boats that are coming across but nobody should be making that journey,” he said.\\nTories on the right of the party are frustrated and have said Sunak should have ensured that a plane would land in east Africa before any election date.\\nOne former minister said: “If the PM truly believed in the plan, which ministers have spent so much time getting right, he would have seen it through, whatever it took. Instead it will be difficult if not impossible to defend because it has not been shown to work.”\\nAnother Conservative said Sunak did not want to take on the European court of human rights, which stopped the last deportation flight to Rwanda in 2022 by issuing a rule 39 injunction. “The suspicion is that Sunak is worried that Strasbourg would attempt to stop the flights again and is unwilling to ignore their rulings,” they said.\\nRefugee charities that have been fighting the plan said it was a “dead duck”. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “The Rwanda plan will go down in the history of British policymaking as an Alice in Wonderland adventure that was both absurd and inhumane.”\\nGovernment lawyers had previously told the high court that the earliest date for flights was the week commencing 24 June. A government source confirmed that the aim was now for flights to take off in July, adding that the timetable and process for flights remained unchanged and that the “late June” date had only ever been the earliest possible date.\\nWhile the smoking ban and Rwanda plan appear set to fall by the wayside, the government did promise on Thursday that a bill would go ahead enabling compensation to be paid to the victims of the contaminated blood scandal. A bill to exonerate post office operators caught up in the Horizon IT scandal passed on Thursday evening.\\nAt an event in Scotland on Thursday evening, at Nigg Energy Park north of Inverness, Sunak urged Starmer to agree to TV debates. “He’s had however many years to think about what he wants to do for the country and, as I said the other day, he doesn’t seem to be able to tell people what he wants to do, doesn’t have a plan, doesn’t have the courage of his convictions,” Sunak said.\\n“But that’s why we need to have these debates, so we can actually debate these issues and people can make a decision on who they think it’s going to provide a secure future for our country.”']\n",

In Great Britain-wide polls, the SNP vote sits between 2% and 4% of national vote share. But its geographical concentration in Scotland means it will win many more seats than other small parties with a similar national vote share, such as the Greens. Targeted Scotland-only polls give a much better indication of how well it will do in the next election than the nationwide polls above.\\nPolls only go so far in predicting who will win in the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system. What matters is the number of seats each party wins in parliament, which is decided by individual races in 650 constituencies.\\ndefault\\nSeat predictions differ, but the one we show above is an average. It takes in three different ways of predicting how voting intention will convert into seats: uniform change projections, multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) models, and other complex models.\\nUniform change assumes that national-level swings will apply uniformly across all constituencies. MRP models estimate the connection between characteristics such as age, gender and the area where a person lives, and which party they will vote for, and then use this data to predict votes in each constituency.\\nHow accurate are seat projections?\\nIn Britain’s first-past-the-post system the numbers in the polls do not correlate cleanly to seats because it depends where votes are located. Describing seat projections from general polling as a “loose yardstick”, Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said: “Labour could get a lead of 15 points and not have a majority, a lead of 10 points and have a majority. It depends where those votes are.”\\nIf the election is close, the polls become less predictive of the outcome. Other limitations of projecting seat counts from national polling include the fact that the Lib Dem seat count is hard to infer from national polling because, while their national support is much lower than the two main parties, in certain constituencies they have a significant presence. Nor is nationwide polling very informative about what will happen in Scotland, and polls there are more infrequent.\\nNotes on the data\\nThe chart shows a rolling 10-day average for the support of each party based on Great Britain-wide polls. This excludes Northern Ireland, which has different political parties. On any given day, the Guardian works out the average support for each party across any poll published in the preceding 10 days. Only polling companies that are members of the British Polling Council are included.\\nStarting 4 June, YouGov changed their polling methodology which they said could lead to smaller Labour leads due to the effects of tactical voting.\\nThe seat projections are sourced Professor Stephen Fisher, Dr John Kenny, Paul Furey, and Polina Ryzhuk, Elections Etc and the universities of Oxford and East Anglia. They are based on an average of opinion-poll vote-intention based forecasts including uniform change projections, multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) models, and other complex models. Forecasts are averaged within those categories before averaging across the categories. They are updated twice a week.\\nIllustrations by Sam Kerr.

      "Harris Campaign Looks Poised to Beat Trump’s July Cash Haul ||| The Trump campaign reported raising $139 million along with allied groups. The vice president’s campaign previously reported $200 million raised in the seven days after President Biden dropped out. The Trump campaign said that it and its allied groups had raised $139 million in July, an enormous sum — but well short of the $200 million Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign said it brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The sum cited by the Trump campaign on Thursday sent it and its allies into August with $327 million in their bank accounts. It makes July one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with an outpouring of donations totaling $141 million. After collecting $112 million in June, the Trump team saw donations tick up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked JD Vance to be his running mate — events that are sure to have motivated his donors and supporters. The Harris campaign had not announced its own numbers as of Thursday afternoon. But based on previous self-disclosures, the month of July will be a study in sudden reversals. Fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide: The Harris campaign said it raised $200 million in just seven days after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid. That was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year.  July is set to be the second straight month that Democrats had out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold in July. Theodore Schleifer writes about campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.\n",

      "Biden Is Out, and Democrats Have a Whole New Set of Questions ||| Newsletter An earthshaking political moment finally arrived, and the transformation of the campaign starts now. It’s over. At 1:46 p.m., with the minute hand of the clock pointed to the number of his presidency, President Biden somberly ended his untenable re-election campaign and sought to give his downtrodden party something he could no longer provide: a sense of hope. “It is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down,” he wrote in a letter posted to X, “and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.” It was an earthshaking political moment many Democrats had been clamoring for — so I’m struck by how quietly it came, and with how little fanfare. Biden’s choice, made while he is at his Delaware beach house after testing positive for Covid-19, did not leak. He told some of his senior staff only a minute before he told the world, my colleague Katie Rogers reported. He did not make a speech to the public, though he said he will later this week. His campaign’s transformation, though, starts now. About half an hour after he withdrew, Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris. A little after 4 p.m., she made it official herself. “My intention,” Harris said in a statement distributed by the Biden for President campaign, “is to earn and win this nomination.” In an all-staff call, the campaign’s leaders said they were now all working for Harris for President, according to my colleague Reid Epstein. \n",

      "Supreme Court Rejects Bid to Trademark ‘Trump Too Small’ ||| The decision was unanimous but fractured in rationale, with several justices objecting to the majority’s use of a history-based test. The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a California lawyer’s attempt to trademark the phrase “Trump too small.” The decision was unanimous on the bottom line but badly fractured on the rationale, with the justices arguing over whether a history-based methodology introduced in a recent Second Amendment case should be used to decide First Amendment disputes. The case concerned a federal law that forbids the registration of trademarks “identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.” “We hold only that history and tradition establish that the particular restriction before us,” Justice Thomas wrote for five justices, “does not violate the First Amendment.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a concurring opinion that in places read like a dissent, was sharply critical of what she said was “the indeterminacy of the court’s history-and-tradition inquiry, which one might aptly describe as the equivalent of entering a crowded cocktail party and looking over everyone’s heads to find your friends.” “To make matters worse,\" she went on, “the five-justice majority that undertakes this tradition-as-dispositive inquiry found its friends in a crowded party to which it was not invited. That majority has drawn conclusive inferences from its historical evidence, all without any guidance from the litigants or the court below.” \n",

      "A Hollywood Heavyweight Is Biden’s Secret Weapon Against Trump |||  The longtime movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg always sought scary villains for his films. Now he has found what he considers a real-life one in Donald J. Trump. Jeffrey Katzenberg has become one of the biggest champions of President Biden in his re-election effort.Credit...Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Peter Baker has covered the past five presidents and reported from Washington. When President Biden made clear last year that he was planning to run for another term, some important Democratic contributors expressed doubt. He was too old, they feared. He was not up to another four years. It fell to Jeffrey Katzenberg to tell them they were wrong. When some still did not believe him, Mr. Katzenberg challenged them to come to Washington and find out for themselves — then arranged to bring the dubious donors to the White House to sit down with the octogenarian president to convince them he was still sharp enough. “He was like, ‘Trust me. And if you don’t trust me, trust, but verify. Come with me and see for yourself and engage with the president,’” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a longtime ally of Mr. Katzenberg, recounted in an interview. “And he started doing that in a consistent way.” In the end, Mr. Newsom added, “He really was instrumental in getting people off the sidelines and getting them to dive headfirst in this campaign.” Few have dived headfirst into the president’s re-election campaign more thoroughly than Mr. Katzenberg. The longtime Hollywood mogul known for “The Lion King” and “Shrek,” among many others, Mr. Katzenberg has been one of the most prolific cash generators for Democratic presidents for a generation. On Saturday night, he will bring Mr. Biden together with former President Barack Obama, George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jimmy Kimmel for a star-studded fund-raiser in Los Angeles, following the $26 million fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall in March he arranged with Mr. Obama and former President Bill Clinton. While Mr. Katzenberg has not solved Mr. Biden’s age problem by any means and Biden aides noted that some of those he brought to the White House did not need convincing, his efforts to validate the president with the well-heeled set have helped build a war chest that has been outpacing the Trump campaign. But he has gone far beyond his past political work, joining Mr. Biden’s campaign as a co-chairman and investing himself fully in the effort to defeat former President Donald J. Trump. He can be found in the halls of the West Wing offering advice and counsel. He was at Camp David the weekend before the State of the Union address, helping the president prepare for his nationally televised speech. He pushes the campaign to tape reaction videos of the president for social media and connected Biden aides with writers to help come up with jokes for the president to deliver at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. \n",

      "Should Hundreds of Millions in Seized Assets Go to ISIS Victims? ||| Syria After Civil War The State and Justice Departments disagree about what to do with more than half a billion dollars after a French company pleaded guilty to aiding militants in war-torn Syria. Charlie Savage has been writing about national security and legal policy for more than two decades. He reported from Washington. Biden administration officials are divided over what to do with $687 million in assets a French company forfeited after pleading guilty to aiding terrorist groups like the Islamic State, according to people familiar with internal deliberations. The dispute, which has pitted the State Department against the Justice Department, raises a tangle of legal, moral and policy problems about the financial implications of executive branch officials handling an unusually large amount of money that has not gone through the usual process of being appropriated for a specific purpose by Congress. Among the points of contention: whether the administration can or should funnel some of the money toward helping international victims of ISIS, most of whom are still in Syria or are refugees elsewhere in the Middle East. Adding to the complications, a group of ISIS victims now living in the United States also want a share of the assets. They are represented by Amal Clooney, a prominent human rights lawyer who is married to George Clooney, the actor who is helping raise money for Mr. Biden’s re-election campaign, and by Lee Wolosky, a former Biden administration official. The vast sum at stake comes from the first prosecution of a corporation for conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization. In 2022, the French building materials giant Lafarge pleaded guilty to paying off ISIS and another terrorist group in Syria, the Nusra Front, in 2013 and 2014, to ensure that it could keep operating a plant in the region. When the civil war in Syria broke out, Lafarge had just built an expensive cement factory in the northern part of that country. Officials at the company struck the unusual agreement with militant groups, court papers said, in part so it would be in a position to profit off the need to rebuild in Syria when the war ended. \n",

      "In News Conference, Biden Has Slips but Shows Strength on Foreign Policy ||| In a nearly hourlong appearance, President Biden hit back at questions about his fitness for office and engaged in long discourses on China and Gaza. By Michael D. Shear Michael D. Shear covers the White House and reported from Washington.  During a nearly hourlong news conference on Thursday, President Biden delivered a series of sometimes shaky answers but also demonstrated a command of foreign policy and avoided a repeat of the worst moments of his debate performance that prompted calls for him to abandon his re-election campaign. After initially reading from a teleprompter and repeating his vow to stay in the race, Mr. Biden tried to hit back at questions about his age and fitness for office. At one point, he fumbled a question about Vice President Kamala Harris by saying that he “wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president” if he did not have confidence in her. Before the news conference even started, Mr. Biden had introduced President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine as “President Putin” at a NATO summit in Washington before quickly correcting himself. The solo news conference, his first in eight months, was designed to demonstrate that Mr. Biden remains capable of the nimbleness and stamina required to continue his campaign against former President Donald J. Trump. In the end, it appeared to do little to change the discussion roiling the country and his party, with some allies leaping to his defense and others calling for him to step aside for someone else. The president took questions from 11 reporters as he faced enormous pressure; even some of his longtime advisers and allies are said to be considering ways to persuade him to end his candidacy. In the two weeks since his disastrous debate performance, 18 Democratic lawmakers have called on him to drop his bid for re-election. On Thursday night, just minutes after the news conference ended, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, called on the president to end his campaign. Representatives Eric Sorensen of Illinois and Scott Peters of California followed suit. \n",

      "Philadelphia District Attorney Sues Musk Over $1 Million Voter Giveaways ||| Larry Krasner, the top prosecutor in Philadelphia, sued Elon Musk and his Trump-supporting super PAC, saying the giveaways amounted to an “unlawful lottery.” District Attorney Larry Krasner of Philadelphia filed a lawsuit on Monday to stop Elon Musk and his Trump-supporting organization, America PAC, from continuing their $1 million daily giveaway in Pennsylvania, calling it an illegal lottery scheme to influence voters in the presidential election. Mr. Musk’s giveaway, which had already prompted the Justice Department to warn that it might violate federal law, purports to “randomly” reward registered voters in seven battleground states who signed a conservative petition by America PAC, which is mobilizing voters to support Mr. Trump. “America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens — and others in the Commonwealth (and other swing states in the upcoming election) — to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million,” the lawsuit said. “That is a lottery. And it is indisputably an unlawful lottery.” The civil suit, which names Mr. Musk and America PAC as defendants, requests that a state court halt further operation of the sweepstakes in Pennsylvania.  The suit also accuses Mr. Musk and America PAC of violating state consumer protection laws by deploying deceptive or misleading statements. As one example, Mr. Krasner argues that winners are not, in fact, random because “multiple winners that have been selected are individuals who have shown up at Trump rallies in Pennsylvania.” America PAC responded to a request for comment on Monday by sending a post on X about a recent $1 million winner of the sweepstakes in Michigan. Allies of Mr. Musk have previously argued that the giveaway awards people only for signing a petition, rather than paying them to register. \n",

      "Liz Cheney and Harris Make a Play for G.O.P. Women in ‘Blue Wall’ Suburbs ||| As the pair campaigned together in suburban areas of battleground states, the Republican former congresswoman served as Ms. Harris’s ambassador to conservative women. transcript I’m honored to have made the decision to endorse Vice President Harris, and — [crowd cheering] and I have gotten to spend time with Vice President Harris. I have had the chance to talk with her about how important it is that we have two strong parties in our country, about the kind of president that I know she’ll be. I think that we are facing a choice in this election. It’s not about party. It’s about right and wrong. And I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, “I can’t be public.” They do worry about a whole range of things, including violence. But they’ll do the right thing. And I would just remind people: If you’re at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody. And there will be millions of Republicans who do that on Nov. 5. By Erica L. Green and Reid J. Epstein Erica L. Green is traveling to three states with Kamala Harris on Monday. Reid J. Epstein reported from Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris made a concerted effort on Monday to appeal to Republican women in the nation’s suburbs, using former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming as her ambassador to conservatives during events in well-to-do suburbs of the biggest cities in three important battleground states. Stumping together in town-hall-style settings before intimate crowds at small theaters in the Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia suburbs, Ms. Harris and Ms. Cheney presented a united front against former President Donald J. Trump — though it was Ms. Cheney who offered the clearest rationale for why Republicans should vote for Ms. Harris. On abortion rights, national security and foreign policy, Ms. Cheney painted Mr. Trump as irresponsibly dangerous while describing Ms. Harris as the safer, reasonable choice to maintain the stability of the country and protect women’s health. “It’s not about party, it’s about right and wrong,” Ms. Cheney told the audience in Royal Oak, Mich., in a theater that in past presidential campaigns hosted events for Mitt Romney. “I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, ‘I can’t be public.’ They do worry about a whole range of things, including violence, but they’ll do the right thing. And I would just remind people, if you’re at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody.” Ms. Cheney sought to build a permission structure for Republicans to vote for a Democrat as the Harris campaign focuses heavily on appeals to conservative women in the suburbs, whom aides view as a key group of undecided voters in the race’s closing days. Many of these women have spent years voting for candidates who are far more closely aligned with Ms. Cheney on social and foreign policy issues than they are with Ms. Harris — which helps explain why the vice president mostly repeated her campaign’s talking points as the former Wyoming congresswoman tried to make news with her support. \n",

      "U.S. Uncovers Russian Plot to Assassinate C.E.O. of German Arms Maker ||| Russia-Ukraine War The company produces artillery shells and tanks that Ukraine has used in its war against Russia. By Julian E. BarnesLara Jakes and Christopher F. Schuetze Julian E. Barnes and Lara Jakes reported from Washington, and Christopher F. Schuetze from Berlin. American intelligence agencies uncovered a Russian plot to kill the chief executive of a German weapons manufacturer, according to multiple Western officials, as Moscow steps up a campaign to undermine support for Ukraine’s war effort. The United States warned Germany about the plot, and German officials increased protection for Armin Papperger, who leads Rheinmetall, which makes artillery shells and tanks that Ukraine has used in its war against Russia. This year, Russian military intelligence has carried out a series of arsons aimed at disrupting the supply of weapons and other materiel to Ukraine, prompting the expulsion of undercover spies and warnings from NATO. The assassination plot is a significant escalation, officials said, representing a more concerted covert effort to deter Western companies from producing supplies for Ukraine. A senior Western intelligence official said that the threats were flagged this past spring. Mr. Papperger was the only defense industry figure who was targeted by name or for whom the Russians appeared to have developed an advanced plan for the assassination, officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Russian operation. The senior Western intelligence official said the plan was advanced to the point where Mr. Papperger had taken protective measures. Other threats that targeted European defense industry officials were more vague, the official said. The plot, and the U.S. efforts to disrupt it, were earlier reported by CNN. American, German and NATO officials would not comment on specifics of the plot, but they denounced Moscow’s sabotage and hybrid-style attacks in Europe. \n",

      "Vance and Walz Make Dueling Appearances, as Voting Begins in Arizona ||| The two vice-presidential candidates crisscrossed the state on the first day of early voting, saying little of each other after their debate last week. By Chris Cameron and Rebecca Davis O’Brien Reporting from Arizona. Senator JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota opened the first day of voting in Arizona on Wednesday with a spree of campaign events across the state, zeroing in on a crucial swing state after their debate last week. Arizona, with its 11 Electoral College votes, has no clear favorite in the presidential race — even as polls there show a slight lead by former President Donald J. Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Trump won the state by a significant margin in 2016, and President Biden won the state in 2020 by less than 11,000 votes — a narrow victory that both campaigns highlighted as evidence that every vote in the state will matter this year. The two vice-presidential candidates fanned out in the morning from luxury hotels near Phoenix and Tucson, and their motorcades crisscrossed desert highways to campaign in the two urban centers. Mr. Vance first held a rally in Tucson before attending a town-hall event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Conference in Mesa, near Phoenix. Mr. Walz visited a Veterans of Foreign Wars post and met with tribal leaders on tribal land, near Phoenix, before holding a campaign rally in the evening at a high school gym in Tucson. Mr. Walz and Mr. Vance said little of each other — instead directing their attacks at each other’s running mates — even as the two came close to crossing paths in Phoenix. Mr. Vance flew from Tucson to Phoenix in the midafternoon, and his campaign jet was parked nearby as Mr. Walz boarded his own campaign jet for the short hop to Tucson later that day. Speaking to supporters at an outdoor rally in sweltering heat at the Tucson Speedway, Mr. Vance urged Arizona residents to vote early, saying that “the best way to make sure your voice is counted is to make sure it’s counted early.” The appeal contradicts the messaging by his running mate, Mr. Trump, who continues to stoke doubts about mail voting. \n",
