      "The﻿ Metropolitan police have indicated that the dropped Conservative candidate Craig Williams could come under the scope of a criminal investigation into betting on the election that has overshadowed Rishi Sunak’s campaign. Scotland Yard will investigate any suspicious bets that could represent a misconduct in public office offence, while the Gambling Commission will continue to look at whether betting rules were broken. The prime minister repeatedly refused to say whether he told Williams, his closest parliamentary aide, about the date of the election, wrongly claiming he could prejudice the watchdog’s inquiry. So far, five Conservatives are known to have been caught up in the Gambling Commission inquiry since the Guardian revealed two weeks ago that Williams had placed a £100 bet with Ladbrokes three days before Sunak announced the date. Related: Who’s who of the people linked to the general election betting scandal The Tories have withdrawn the party’s support for Williams’ campaign to be returned as the MP for the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr seat, after he admitted having a “flutter” on the election date. During a campaign visit in Derbyshire, Sunak was repeatedly asked whether he had confided in Williams before his surprise announcement of a summer election. “I’ve been clear about this. I’m furious to have learned about these allegations,” he said. “We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own, because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail.” The prime minister was told he could not prejudice the investigation and that he was free to answer the question. However, he responded: “You’ll recognise that while there are ongoing independent investigations, it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.” The number of Metropolitan police officers under investigation over bets on the timing of the general election has risen to at least seven, the force has said. Britain’s biggest police force said it would continue to investigate a “small number” of wagers as part of a joint investigation led by the Gambling Commission, which said it was making “rapid progress”. Sources familiar with the investigation suggested the decision to run parallel inquires could be an attempt to dampen the frenzy around MPs betting on themselves to win or lose their seats, which may be considered unwise but is not illegal. One Met officer, a protection officer for the prime minister , is under investigation for misconduct in public office after allegedly placing bets on the election date. The close protection officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties, the Met said. It confirmed that “at least” seven officers were under investigation by the Met’s specialist crime command. In a statement, the Met said the majority of cases – believed to be those without specific features that could mean additional offences apply, such as misconduct in public office – would be investigated by the Gambling Commission. The watchdog is also examining bets allegedly placed by Tony Lee, the Conservative party’s campaigns director; his wife, Laura Saunders , the Tory candidate in Bristol North West; and Nick Mason, the Tories’ chief data officer. As many as 15 Conservative candidates and officials are believed to be under investigation over suspicious bets on the date of the election. Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “We are focused on an investigation into confidential information being used to gain an unfair advantage when betting on the date of the general election. Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan police to draw this case to a just conclusion.” Det Supt Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations. There will, however, be a small number of cases where a broader criminal investigation by the police is required. We will aim to provide updates at key points as our investigation progresses.”\n",
      "Новость номер 2:\n",
      "The ongoing betting scandal surrounding the UK general election has taken a dramatic turn, with the Metropolitan Police confirming they may launch a criminal investigation into Craig Williams, the disgraced former Conservative candidate. The development comes as the political storm over alleged insider betting continues to engulf Rishi Sunak's campaign, raising serious questions about integrity at the highest levels of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scotland Yard has announced it will examine whether any suspicious bets related to the election date could constitute misconduct in public office, while the Gambling Commission maintains its parallel investigation into potential breaches of betting regulations. Legal experts suggest this dual-track approach indicates the seriousness of the allegations, with the potential for both regulatory sanctions and criminal charges against those involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal first erupted when it was revealed that Williams, who served as Sunak's parliamentary private secretary, placed a £100 bet on the election date just three days before the Prime Minister's surprise announcement of a July poll. The Conservative Party has since withdrawn support for Williams' campaign in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, though his name remains on the ballot paper as the formal withdrawal deadline has passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a tense campaign stop in Derbyshire, Sunak faced repeated questioning about whether he had disclosed the election date to Williams prior to the public announcement. The Prime Minister's evasive responses have drawn criticism from political opponents and transparency advocates alike. \"I've been clear about this. I'm furious to have learned about these allegations,\" Sunak stated, while refusing to confirm or deny whether he had shared the information with his aide, citing the ongoing investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal analysts note that while politicians discussing election timing isn't unusual, using such privileged information for personal financial gain could cross legal boundaries. Professor Emily Carter, a constitutional law expert at University College London, explains: \"There's a fine line between political speculation and improper advantage. If individuals used confidential information obtained through official positions to place bets, this could potentially meet the threshold for misconduct in public office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of the investigation has widened significantly, with at least seven Metropolitan Police officers now under scrutiny for similar bets. One officer, who served on the Prime Minister's protection detail, has been placed on restricted duties after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer has since been released on bail as inquiries continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gambling Commission's investigation has expanded to include several high-profile Conservative figures, including the party's campaigns director Tony Lee and his wife Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West. Nick Mason, the Conservatives' chief data officer, is also being investigated. Sources suggest as many as fifteen Conservative candidates and officials may ultimately be drawn into the probe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive of the Gambling Commission, emphasized the seriousness with which they're treating the allegations: \"Our focus remains firmly on determining whether confidential information was improperly used to gain betting advantages. We're making good progress and will work closely with police to ensure a thorough and fair resolution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal has prompted calls for stricter regulations around political betting. Transparency International UK has urged reforms to prevent future abuses. \"This case exposes worrying gaps in how we regulate the intersection between political privilege and gambling,\" said their spokesperson. \"There needs to be clearer rules and more robust oversight to maintain public trust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, opposition parties have seized on the controversy as emblematic of wider ethical concerns about the Conservative government. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves argued that \"this betting scandal is symptomatic of a government that's lost its moral compass,\" while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called for an immediate independent inquiry into \"the culture of entitlement at the heart of this Conservative government.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the investigations continue, political analysts suggest the timing couldn't be worse for Sunak's campaign, with the scandal dominating headlines in the crucial final weeks before polling day. The Prime Minister's refusal to provide straightforward answers about his knowledge of Williams' actions has only fueled speculation and damaged his credibility on integrity issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Metropolitan Police have indicated they will provide updates as their investigation progresses, but warned against expecting quick resolutions. With the Gambling Commission also conducting its own detailed inquiry, the political and legal fallout from this unprecedented betting scandal may continue long after election day itself.\n"

      "Paper 0:  The recent decision by the Home Office and Home Secretary Suella Braverman to bar Siyabonga Twala from returning to the UK has sparked outrage and raised serious questions about institutional racism within the country’s immigration policies. Twala, who has a spent conviction for a minor offense—one that he has not repeated—has been left stranded in Turkey, separated from his nine-year-old son and the life he built in Britain. Critics argue that the use of legislation designed to exclude dangerous criminals in this case is not only disproportionate but indicative of systemic bias against Black and minority ethnic individuals.    Legal experts and human rights advocates have condemned the decision, pointing out the stark contrast in how the justice system treats individuals based on race and class. While middle-class and celebrity drug offenses often go unpunished or are dismissed with minimal consequences, Twala’s case highlights the punitive measures disproportionately applied to Black men. The 1999 Macpherson report, which defined institutional racism as a \"collective failure\" resulting in discrimination through prejudice or ignorance, seems alarmingly relevant here. The Home Office’s actions suggest a pattern of racial bias, particularly when viewed alongside the ongoing mistreatment of the Windrush generation, many of whom are still fighting for justice and compensation years after being wrongfully targeted.    Dr. Wanda Wyporska, CEO of the Black Equity Organisation, has been vocal in her criticism, stating that the Home Office’s decision reflects a broader culture of discrimination. \"This is not just about one man being kept from his family—it’s about a system that consistently fails Black Britons,\" she said. \"The fact that the Home Secretary personally intervened to uphold this unjust decision, while Windrush victims continue to suffer without redress, speaks volumes.\"    The emotional toll on Twala’s young son, now deprived of his father’s presence, further underscores the human cost of such policies. Campaigners argue that the Home Office must urgently review its approach to immigration enforcement, ensuring fairness and transparency. Until then, cases like Twala’s will continue to expose deep-seated inequities in Britain’s legal and political systems.    For those who believe in justice and equality, this case serves as a stark reminder that institutional racism persists—and that accountability is long overdue. The Guardian welcomes readers’ perspectives on this issue, urging them to share their views for potential publication in the letters section.\n",
      "Paper 1:  Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to remove David Campbell Bannerman, a controversial right-wing figure, from the Conservative Party’s approved candidates’ list. The former deputy leader of the UK Independence Party (Ukip), who rejoined the Tories in 2011, has sparked outrage among Conservative MPs for his involvement in a grassroots campaign that sought to deselect sitting Tory MPs and undermine the parliamentary inquiry into Boris Johnson’s conduct during the Partygate scandal.    Campbell Bannerman, who previously served as an MEP, co-founded the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO) alongside Tory peer Peter Cruddas, a staunch Johnson loyalist. While the group claims to champion party members’ rights, its activities have been widely criticized as an attempt to destabilize the current leadership and push for Johnson’s return. The CDO orchestrated a mass email campaign targeting members of the Commons privileges committee, urging them to abandon their investigation into whether Johnson misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking gatherings in Downing Street. The inquiry ultimately concluded that Johnson had lied, leading to his resignation as an MP.    The CDO’s aggressive tactics have drawn sharp condemnation from senior Conservatives, who argue that Sunak must take decisive action to uphold the integrity of the party. One MP, speaking anonymously, expressed disbelief that Campbell Bannerman remains on the candidates’ list, stating, “Rishi has repeatedly emphasized the importance of standards and professionalism in government. Allowing someone who has actively worked to undermine a parliamentary inquiry and target fellow Conservatives is completely at odds with that.”    Another Conservative MP went further, branding the situation “insane” and questioning why party headquarters had not intervened sooner. “He doesn’t represent Conservative values—he’s a Ukip defector who has tried to get our own MPs deselected,” the MP said. “This isn’t just damaging to the party; it’s a direct challenge to the prime minister’s authority. Central office has the power to remove him—they just need to act.”    The privileges committee, which included four Tory MPs, was inundated with over 600 emails from CDO supporters, accusing them of conducting a politically motivated “witch hunt” against Johnson. The coordinated campaign, which used a pre-written template, alleged collusion between civil servants, Conservative MPs, and even the Prime Minister’s office to discredit Johnson.    Despite the backlash, Campbell Bannerman insists that the CDO’s mission is to empower grassroots members in candidate selection processes. He has also dismissed claims that his candidacy should be blocked, arguing that any attempt to do so would be unconstitutional. “To defer my eligibility based on political considerations—essentially because I haven’t been sufficiently supportive of Rishi Sunak on social media—is legally dubious,” he said.    The controversy comes at a delicate time for Sunak, who has sought to distance himself from the Johnson era and present himself as a leader committed to restoring trust in politics. With the next general election looming, the prime minister faces a difficult balancing act—placating the party’s right-wing faction while maintaining discipline and unity.    Meanwhile, the South Norfolk constituency, where Campbell Bannerman hopes to stand, is currently held by Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who announced in May that he would not seek re-election. The seat, with a Tory majority of just over 21,000, is considered a safe Conservative stronghold, making it an attractive prospect for any aspiring candidate.    Claire Bullivant, CEO of the CDO and editor of the Conservative Post, has sought to distance Campbell Bannerman from the email campaign, stating that he had no involvement in the initiative. “David would make an outstanding MP, and any suggestion that he was behind the privileges committee campaign is completely false,” she said.    Yet, for many within the party, the issue goes beyond individual candidacies. It raises fundamental questions about the direction of the Conservative Party and whether Sunak can rein in factions that remain loyal to Johnson. As one senior Tory source put it, “This isn’t just about one candidate—it’s about whether the party is serious about moving forward or remains trapped in the battles of the past.”    With tensions escalating, Sunak’s next move will be closely watched. Failure to act decisively risks further alienating moderate Conservatives, while a heavy-handed approach could provoke a backlash from the party’s right wing. For now, the ball is in the prime minister’s court—and his decision could have lasting implications for the Conservative Party’s future.\n",
      "Paper 2:  The political landscape in the UK has been marked by heated exchanges and significant resignations, with tensions flaring between key figures across party lines. One of the most notable clashes unfolded between London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as the two engaged in a war of words over housing policy in the capital. Sunak had earlier criticized Khan’s record on housebuilding, suggesting that the Labour mayor had failed to deliver on promises to address London’s housing crisis. However, Khan swiftly dismissed the prime minister’s remarks as “desperate nonsense,” pointing to his administration’s achievements in constructing more council homes than the rest of England combined and exceeding affordable housing targets.    Khan’s rebuttal was sharp, highlighting the stark contrast between his record and Sunak’s own abandonment of national housebuilding targets. Housing experts have weighed in on the debate, with some arguing that while London has seen progress under Khan, systemic challenges—such as land availability, planning restrictions, and funding constraints—remain major obstacles. Professor Alan Evans, an urban economist at the University of Reading, noted, \"The housing crisis is a complex issue that no single administration can solve alone. While Khan has made strides, the lack of a coherent national strategy under successive governments has hampered progress.\"    Meanwhile, the fallout from the Nigel Farage banking scandal continued to reverberate through the financial sector. Peter Flavel, the chief executive of Coutts, resigned less than 48 hours after NatWest Group CEO Alison Rose stepped down, both casualties of the controversy surrounding the closure of Farage’s accounts. Flavel took “ultimate responsibility” for what he described as the “mishandling” of the situation, though Farage himself remained critical, accusing the bank of political bias. The resignations have raised serious questions about corporate governance and transparency in the banking industry, with financial analysts warning of reputational damage that could extend beyond Coutts and NatWest.    The political dimension of the scandal deepened when Prime Minister Sunak declined to offer his support to Sir Howard Davies, the embattled chair of NatWest Group. Sunak’s reticence has been interpreted as a signal of growing unease within the government over the handling of the affair. Opposition leaders seized on the moment, with Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves calling for stricter oversight of banking practices to prevent similar incidents. “The public deserves to know that financial institutions are not making decisions based on political prejudice,” she said.    In another significant legal development, the High Court ruled that the Home Office’s practice of housing unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels was unlawful. The judgment was hailed as a victory for human rights advocates, with the Refugee Council describing it as a “landmark day for children’s rights.” Enver Solomon, the organization’s chief executive, emphasized that the ruling reaffirmed the obligation to protect vulnerable minors, stating, “There can be no exceptions when the rights of children are at stake.” The Home Office, however, defended its actions as a temporary measure necessitated by unprecedented pressures on the asylum system.    The ruling has intensified scrutiny of the government’s broader immigration policies, particularly its controversial plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. Legal experts suggest that the High Court’s decision could set a precedent for future challenges to the government’s treatment of child migrants. Meanwhile, local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to accommodate unaccompanied minors, with some councils warning that they are already stretched to their limits.    Elsewhere, the political turmoil within the Scottish National Party (SNP) showed no signs of abating. First Minister Humza Yousaf faced backlash from opposition parties after publishing a policy paper on citizenship in an independent Scotland, a move critics dismissed as a distraction from pressing domestic issues. The Scottish Conservatives accused the SNP of misusing public funds, while Labour’s Neil Bibby argued that the government was “out of touch” with the struggles of ordinary Scots. Yousaf, however, remained defiant, insisting that planning for independence was a legitimate use of government resources.    Within his own party, Yousaf sought to downplay tensions after former minister Fergus Ewing publicly criticized the SNP’s direction, describing the atmosphere within the party as “toxic.” Despite Ewing’s vocal dissent, Yousaf ruled out expelling him, emphasizing the importance of internal debate. “People aren’t going to be punished for criticizing me or the party’s direction,” he said. Yet, the public airing of grievances has exposed fractures within the SNP, raising questions about its cohesion ahead of the next general election.    In Westminster, pressure mounted on Conservative MP Nadine Dorries to honor her pledge to resign following her exclusion from Boris Johnson’s resignation honors list. Flitwick Town Council, representing a significant portion of her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, issued an open letter urging her to step down immediately, citing her prolonged absence from parliamentary duties. The council accused Dorries of prioritizing media appearances and political maneuvering over her constituents,\n",
      "Paper 3:  The political drama surrounding Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has escalated as local authorities in her constituency demand her immediate resignation. Flitwick Town Council, representing a key area within her electoral district, has publicly called for Dorries to step down without further delay, arguing that her prolonged absence from parliamentary duties has left constituents without proper representation.    In a strongly worded letter addressed to Dorries and shared on social media, the council accused her of neglecting her responsibilities as an MP while prioritizing media appearances, a forthcoming book, and political maneuvering. The letter, signed by town clerk Stephanie Stanley, highlighted growing frustration among residents, who feel abandoned by their elected representative. Stanley pointed out that Dorries has not maintained an active constituency office for an extended period and has not held a public surgery in Flitwick since March 2020—raising serious concerns about her commitment to serving the local community.    Andy Snape, the town mayor and a local councillor, echoed these sentiments, describing Dorries’ continued hold on the seat as an act of political self-interest. He criticized her for residing in the Cotswolds rather than within Mid Bedfordshire, further distancing herself from the people she was elected to represent. Snape emphasized that the role of an MP is to advocate for constituents in Parliament, scrutinize government policies, and push for legislative improvements—a duty he claims Dorries has failed to fulfill. Instead, he argued, her focus has shifted to her TalkTV program, a new column with the *Daily Mail*, and an upcoming tell-all book that appears designed to settle political scores.    The controversy stems from Dorries’ announcement on June 9 that she would step down as MP \"with immediate effect,\" following her exclusion from Rishi Sunak’s resignation honors list, which denied her a seat in the House of Lords. However, weeks later, she has yet to formally resign, leaving Mid Bedfordshire in political limbo. Downing Street has acknowledged the unusual nature of the situation, with the prime minister’s press secretary noting that it is uncommon for an MP to declare an immediate resignation without following through.    Political analysts suggest that Dorries’ delay may be a calculated move to exert pressure on the government, possibly in hopes of securing a peerage through alternative means. However, this strategy has backfired, drawing criticism from across the political spectrum. Local residents, already grappling with issues such as healthcare access, infrastructure funding, and economic challenges, are growing increasingly impatient. Without an active MP, vital constituency concerns risk being overlooked in Westminster.    Community leaders argue that a by-election must be called as soon as possible to ensure Mid Bedfordshire has a dedicated representative in Parliament. The longer Dorries remains in office without fulfilling her duties, the more damage is done to public trust in the political process. As pressure mounts, the question remains: will Dorries finally step aside, or will she continue to hold her seat hostage in pursuit of personal grievances? For the people of Mid Bedfordshire, the answer cannot come soon enough.\n",
      "Paper 4:  The Scottish government has unveiled ambitious proposals outlining how citizenship would function in an independent Scotland, drawing inspiration from Ireland’s inclusive model. First Minister Humza Yousaf presented the plans, which aim to simplify the citizenship process by removing mandatory tests and drastically lowering application fees—a stark contrast to the UK government’s stricter immigration policies. The announcement has reignited tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster, particularly over whether Scottish taxpayer funds should be allocated to preparations for potential independence.    The document, part of the \"Building a New Scotland\" series initiated by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, advocates for a citizenship framework that would automatically grant Scottish nationality to individuals born abroad if at least one parent holds Scottish citizenship. This approach mirrors Ireland’s system, which has long been praised for its flexibility and inclusivity. Additionally, the paper suggests that passports issued by an independent Scotland would adhere to European Union standards, featuring the traditional burgundy red color—a symbolic nod to the nation’s aspirations of rejoining the EU.    Yousaf emphasized the urgency of addressing Scotland’s demographic challenges, particularly its aging population, during a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh with refugees from Ukraine and Syria. He argued that a more welcoming citizenship policy would help attract and retain talent, bolstering the workforce and economic growth. Under the proposed system, individuals would automatically qualify for Scottish citizenship if they are British citizens residing in Scotland, were born in the country, have a parent who is a British citizen born in Scotland, or have lived in Scotland for at least a decade. While dual nationality would be permitted, individuals would retain the right to decline Scottish citizenship or renounce their British status if they choose.    The First Minister acknowledged that some might prefer to keep their British citizenship, stating, \"It’s important to recognize that people will feel strongly about retaining their British identity, and we should respect that choice.\" However, he expressed hope that the vast majority would embrace Scottish citizenship, given its potential benefits, including restored EU membership rights such as freedom of movement. Although rejoining the EU is not guaranteed, the Scottish government has signaled its intent to pursue membership swiftly, a move that would significantly enhance the value of a Scottish passport.    The proposals also include a new visa category for individuals with Scottish grandparents, facilitating easier access to citizenship for diaspora communities. Furthermore, the paper suggests that an independent Scotland could remain part of the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless movement for British and Irish citizens without border checks. This arrangement would maintain longstanding ties while allowing Scotland to forge its own immigration policies.    The announcement has drawn criticism from political opponents, with Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, Neil Bibby, accusing Yousaf of being \"out of touch\" for prioritizing independence discussions amid a severe cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly rejected calls for a second independence referendum, leaving the Scottish National Party (SNP) to frame the next general election as a de facto vote on the issue.    Adding to the controversy, Simon Case, the UK’s top civil servant, recently raised concerns about Scottish government officials working on independence-related policies, calling it \"unusual and a bit worrying.\" Case indicated that new guidance would be issued to clarify the boundaries of civil servants' roles in constitutional matters. Yousaf dismissed these concerns, asserting that the legal basis for the independence papers was sound and accusing opposition parties of attempting to stifle democratic debate.    Experts have weighed in on the feasibility of the proposals, with some praising the ambition while cautioning about practical challenges. Dr. Fiona Hill, a political analyst at the University of Edinburgh, noted, \"The Irish model is an attractive blueprint, but Scotland would need to navigate complex negotiations with both the UK and the EU to realize these plans.\" Others have pointed to potential economic hurdles, particularly if Scotland faces resistance from Westminster in establishing its own immigration and border policies.    As the debate intensifies, the Scottish government remains steadfast in its vision, framing independence as an opportunity to create a more equitable and globally connected nation. Whether these proposals gain traction will depend not only on political will but also on public sentiment as Scotland grapples with its future relationship with the UK and the wider world.\n"

      "The Conservative Party is facing yet another scandal as Lancashire police prepare to contact suspended MP Mark Menzies following explosive allegations that campaign funds were misused to pay off individuals described as \"bad people.\" The controversy has sent shockwaves through Westminster, with Labour leader Keir Starmer demanding a full police investigation and questioning why the Conservative Party took months to act on the claims.    Menzies, who represents Fylde and previously served as a government trade envoy to several South American countries, was suspended by the Conservative Party after reports surfaced that he allegedly pressured an aide to hand over thousands of pounds in the middle of the night to resolve a personal crisis. According to *The Times*, Menzies reportedly called his former campaign manager—now a party volunteer—at 3:15 a.m. in December, claiming he was being held in a flat by \"bad people\" and urgently needed £5,000 for what he described as a \"life and death\" situation. The sum later increased to £6,500, which was allegedly paid from the personal savings of his constituency office manager before being reimbursed from campaign donations.    Lancashire police confirmed they were aware of the reports but noted that no formal complaint had been filed. A spokesperson stated that officers would reach out to those involved to determine whether they wished to pursue the matter further. Legal experts suggest that if the allegations are substantiated, Menzies could face serious consequences, including potential fraud charges. \"Misuse of campaign funds is a serious breach of electoral law,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a political ethics expert at the University of Manchester. \"If money intended for political campaigning was diverted for personal use, this could constitute a criminal offense.\"    The Conservative Party has come under fire for its handling of the situation. Chief Whip Simon Hart reportedly referred the matter to party headquarters three months ago after being approached by a whistleblower, yet no immediate action was taken. Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds has written to her Conservative counterpart, Richard Holden, demanding answers about why the party failed to act sooner and whether it had advised those involved to contact the police. \"The public deserves transparency,\" Dodds wrote. \"These are deeply disturbing allegations, and the Conservative Party must explain why it appears to have dragged its feet.\"    Menzies has denied the claims, stating that he has \"fully complied with all the rules for declarations\" and will not comment further while an investigation is ongoing. However, sources close to the MP have provided a conflicting narrative, suggesting that the incident stemmed from a personal encounter gone wrong. According to one account, Menzies met a man on a dating app and later found himself in a situation where he was pressured into paying thousands under false pretenses. The source claimed that individuals at a second location falsely accused him of causing damage and demanded payment, leaving him fearful of the consequences if he refused.    This scandal is the latest in a string of controversies plaguing the Conservative Party. In recent months, multiple MPs have either resigned or been suspended over misconduct allegations, including William Wragg, who admitted to sharing colleagues' personal details after being blackmailed, and Scott Benton and Peter Bone, who stepped down following parliamentary investigations. The ongoing turmoil has fueled criticism that the party is failing to uphold standards in public life.    Defense Secretary Grant Shapps acknowledged that the Conservatives had been aware of the allegations against Menzies \"for a while\" but claimed that \"further information came to light yesterday,\" prompting the suspension. Meanwhile, Starmer seized on the scandal during a visit to Teesside, arguing that it underscores the need for political change. \"Once again, we're talking about misconduct by Tory MPs,\" he said. \"This is exactly why the country needs a fresh start with Labour.\"    The timing of the revelations is particularly damaging for the Conservatives, coming just weeks before crucial local and mayoral elections. Political analysts suggest that the repeated scandals could further erode public trust in the party. \"Voters are tired of seeing headlines about MPs embroiled in controversy,\" said Professor James Whitaker, a political commentator. \"This kind of story reinforces the perception of a party in disarray.\"    As the investigation unfolds, questions remain about whether the Conservative Party will take further disciplinary action and whether Menzies will retain his seat in Parliament. The case also raises broader concerns about the oversight of campaign finances and the mechanisms in place to hold MPs accountable for misconduct. For now, all eyes are on Lancashire police to determine whether the allegations warrant a criminal inquiry—and whether this scandal will be the tipping point in an already tumultuous political climate.\n",

      "A Conservative MP who was suspended over allegations that campaign funds were misused to pay off “bad people” is to be contacted by police over the matter. Keir Starmer earlier called for a police investigation into allegations that campaign funds were misused by the Fylde MP, Mark Menzies, who was also suspended as a government trade envoy to Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina. Lancashire police said that while no complaint had been made they planned to talk to those involved following reports about the MP, who faces claims that he demanded thousands of pounds from an aide to pay off “bad people” in the middle of the night last December. The Conservatives took action on Wednesday night after the allegations were made public in a report by the Times . Labour wrote to the Conservatives asking whether the party had referred the matter to the police. The Tories have yet to involve the police and say they will decide what to do after concluding their own inquiry. The chief whip, Simon Hart, passed the matter to his party HQ three months ago after being approached by what sources describe as a “whistleblower”. Menzies said in a statement: “I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further.” According to the Times, Menzies phoned his former campaign manager, now a party volunteer, at 3.15am one night in December saying he was locked in a flat by “some bad people” and needed £5,000 as a matter of “life and death”. Hours later, the sum had risen to £6,500, and was said to have been paid from the personal savings of Menzies’ constituency office manager. She was reported to have been reimbursed from campaign donations. Lancashire police said in a statement on Thursday evening: “We are aware of reports in the media relating to a serving member of parliament. No complaint has been made to the police at this stage. We will make contact with those impacted in due course to see whether they wish to make a complaint.” It is understood that this will involve contacting the MP. The case is the latest alleged misconduct scandal to rock the Conservative party. It comes after William Wragg, another MP who has since resigned the Tory whip, claimed he handed over colleagues’ personal numbers to someone who had compromising material on him. As many as eight MPs who were elected as Conservatives in 2019 are now sitting as independents, having lost the whip. This is in addition to others such as Scott Benton and Peter Bone , who both quit as MPs after parliamentary investigations found they breached misconduct rules, and David Warburton, who resigned after allegations of misconduct. Asked about Menzies, Starmer told reporters during a visit to Teesside: “There are obviously a lot of unanswered questions in relation to these allegations. Not least why it seems the Conservative party took so long to act and whether they’ve reported this to the police, who it seems to me should be involved in this. “I’ll be honest, there’s a degree of frustration as well. We’re two weeks away from really important political and mayoral elections … And yet again we’re talking about misbehaviour by Tory MPs and if ever you needed evidence of why we need to turn the page on this … and have a fresh start with Labour, I think it’s in these allegations coming out today.” Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, said on Thursday morning that the Conservatives had been aware of the claims “for a while” but “further information came to light yesterday”. According to an account given to the Times by a source close to Menzies, he asked for the money after meeting a man he met on a dating website. The source said Menzies had gone to the man’s flat before going with another man to a second address, where he continued drinking. People at the address falsely claimed he had been sick and demanded £5,000 for cleaning up and other expenses, according to this account. The source close to Menzies told the Times he paid the money because he was afraid of what would happen if he refused, but had insufficient funds in his own savings. They claimed he offered to repay the sum, but that local Tories who controlled the campaign funds said he did not need to. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, wrote on Thursday to the Conservative party chair, Richard Holden, questioning what she chracterised as an apparent lack of action in relation to the “disturbing” allegations. “The Conservative party has reportedly been aware of these serious accusations for over three months. What action was taken, by whom, and when?” she wrote in the letter. Dodds also asked whether CCHQ had advised those involved to contact the police and whether the party itself had reported the matter. A decade ago, Menzies quit as a ministerial aide after allegations about his behaviour by a Brazilian male escort.\n",

      "The ideological shift away from free-market economics has become one of the defining political transformations of the 21st century. What was once the dominant economic philosophy of the Thatcher-Reagan era has gradually faded from mainstream discourse, replaced by a more interventionist approach embraced by governments, institutions, and even corporate leaders. In her new book, *Ten Years to Save the West*, former British Prime Minister Liz Truss argues that this abandonment of small government and low-tax principles lies at the heart of Britain’s economic stagnation. She directs much of her criticism toward what she describes as an entrenched bureaucratic elite—unelected technocrats who, in her view, routinely override democratic mandates in favor of their own policy preferences.    Truss singles out three key institutions—the Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)—as the primary obstacles to her vision of economic revival. She dismisses them collectively as a \"three-headed hydra,\" an unaccountable power structure that stifles growth and innovation. Yet, while her book presents a forceful defense of her short-lived premiership, there are glaring omissions in her account—particularly the economic turmoil that unfolded during her 49 days in office, a period so brief it was famously outlasted by a lettuce in a viral media stunt.    ### The Bond Market Meltdown: Warnings Ignored?    One of the most dramatic moments of Truss’s tenure was the financial market upheaval triggered by her government’s \"mini-budget,\" a sweeping package of unfunded tax cuts that sent shockwaves through global markets. In her book, she claims that no one warned her about potential instability in the bond markets, nor did anyone raise concerns about liability-driven investments (LDIs), a complex financial instrument used by pension funds. However, this assertion contradicts documented evidence.    Internal briefings prepared for Truss by her own economic advisers explicitly cautioned that markets were already nervous about the UK’s fiscal trajectory. A confidential memo, circulated weeks before the mini-budget, warned that if policy announcements were mishandled, a market crash was a real possibility. This raises questions about whether Truss disregarded expert advice—or whether she simply underestimated the scale of the reaction her policies would provoke.    ### The Pensions Crisis: A Tinderbox Waiting to Ignite    Truss does acknowledge that the LDI crisis played a role in the financial chaos, though she portrays it as an unforeseeable disaster. While it’s true that LDIs were an obscure corner of the pensions market, the Financial Times had already highlighted their vulnerabilities months earlier. The real issue, however, was not just the existence of LDIs but the broader economic environment in which they operated.    By the summer of 2022, global bond yields were already rising as central banks aggressively hiked interest rates to combat inflation fueled by the war in Ukraine. The mini-budget, with its dramatic tax cuts and lack of independent scrutiny, acted as a catalyst for a full-blown crisis. The UK’s borrowing costs surged at an unprecedented rate—so much so that City economists began referring to the spike as the \"moron premium.\" The Bank of England was ultimately forced to intervene to prevent a complete financial meltdown, buying up government bonds to stabilize the market.    ### Comparing Fiscal Risks: Furlough vs. the Mini-Budget    In defending her approach, Truss argues that previous large-scale spending commitments—such as the £70 billion furlough scheme during the pandemic—did not trigger market panic, so why should her tax cuts? This comparison, however, overlooks crucial differences in economic conditions.    First, the furlough scheme was implemented at a time when central banks were actively suppressing borrowing costs through quantitative easing. By 2022, inflation was soaring, and monetary policy had shifted dramatically. Second, Truss’s energy price guarantee—a separate but simultaneous policy—was already set to cost up to £200 billion, meaning her tax cuts added to an already staggering fiscal burden. Unlike furlough, which was widely seen as a necessary emergency measure, her policies lacked broad political or economic consensus.    ### The \"Anti-Growth Coalition\" and Institutional Backlash    Truss’s belief that her policies were sabotaged by a shadowy \"anti-growth coalition\" of bureaucrats, economists, and international institutions is a recurring theme in her book. She points to criticism from the IMF, Goldman Sachs, and even US President Joe Biden as evidence of a coordinated effort to undermine her agenda.    Yet the reality is that skepticism toward her economic plan was not confined to the so-called establishment. Many independent analysts questioned the wisdom of unfunded tax cuts tilted toward high earners, arguing they would do little to stimulate growth. The OBR, which Truss sidelined, was not alone in its concerns—major investment banks and international bodies shared the same doubts.    ### The Bank of England: A Contradictory Critique    Truss’s relationship with the Bank of England is particularly fraught. At times,\n",

      "Raw free-market economics is missing in action. Somewhere between its 1980s ascendancy and today, the media, politicians, civil service and even the corporate mainstream abandoned small government and low taxes. At the heart of Liz Truss’s new book, Ten Years to Save the West , the former prime minister reckons this is the reason for Britain’s economic drift, alongside “unelected technocrats” overruling the “wishes of the people”. The UK’s main economic institutions – the Treasury, Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility (a “three-headed hydra”) – come under fire for standing in the way of her project, launched not with an election mandate but a Tory party selection process. However, could there be other lessons from Truss’s 49 days in power – measurable in the shelf life of a lettuce – unacknowledged in a book with more pages? Bond market meltdown “There was no word of warning about any likely issues with the bond markets, and no one mentioned the issues surrounding liability-driven investments.” The trouble is, this does not appear to be entirely true. Truss’s own economic advisers warned her that markets could crash if her policy changes were not handled with care. Weeks before the mini-budget her team presented her with a paper that said: “The markets are nervous about the UK and about policy options. If immediate economic policy announcements are handled badly then a market crash is possible.” Pensions crisis Truss could more reasonably claim ignorance over liability-driven investments (LDIs). The Financial Times had sounded the alarm two months earlier , but it still remained a relatively obscure corner of the pensions market. But to blame LDIs puts the cart before the horse. “It really was a tinderbox waiting for a spark – and the market upheaval provided it,” writes Truss. But what triggered that market upheaval? Government bond yields had been climbing in the summer of 2022 as the world’s leading central banks raised interest rates to combat soaring inflation after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the mini-budget triggered a far more extreme jump in the UK, in a development labelled the “ moron premium ” by City economists. Over four days, long-dated government bond yields rose by more than the annual increase in 23 of the past 27 years, in a “ doom loop ” as the financial crisis started to feed on itself before the Bank of England stepped in . Smaller than furlough? Truss argues “there had not been a major market reaction against recent spending commitments, including the furlough scheme, which had cost £70bn. In the greater scheme of things, the mini-budget’s effect on government borrowing was relatively small.” However, furlough came in a very different context. First, Truss had already committed to an energy price guarantee that could have cost as much as £200bn over 18 months. Her £45bn in tax cuts added to this already vast borrowing commitment. Second, furlough came as the world’s largest central banks were buying billions of pounds in government bonds – keeping borrowing costs low. With inflation rising, those factors had kicked into reverse. The anti-growth coalition Furlough had been generally well received for preventing the biggest economic collapse in 300 years from becoming far worse by permanently scarring the economy. By contrast, economists thought tax cuts directed at the rich would have a minimal impact on growth. And this was not the view of the OBR (it had not been asked to give one); but of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America . Alongside criticism from the International Monetary Fund and President Joe Biden, Truss says “it became clear we were not just challenging UK economic orthodoxy, this groupthink extended to the leading powers of the west”. The Bank of England In a book railing against short-termism and institutions, Truss reveals she thought about abolishing the OBR and sacking the Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, but concluded such a “declaration of war on the economic establishment” would have taken time she did not have. Her criticism of the central bank is, though, topsy-turvy in places. In one chapter she writes: “Central banks from the Federal Reserve to the Bank of England colluded with spendthrift governments, allowing money-printing to pay for the largesse.” But later she complains that turning off the printing press contributed to her downfall, as it drove up borrowing costs, and grumbles that the bank perhaps did not collude with her enough. Truss is at least right that markets thought the bank was behind the curve with its interest rate stance. But it had made clear mo nths earlier that it would begin reversing its quantitative easing programme by selling government bonds from September 2022. Most economists do not buy that this was the primary contributor to the market meltdown after the mini-budget. It certainly did not help. But then why throw caution to the wind with a radical budget against this backdrop? City bankers blamed the unexpectedly large tax cuts in the mini-budget, particularly plans to scrap the 45p additional rate of income tax , alongside a wider undermining of the UK’s institutional framework: sacking the Treasury permanent secretary, Tom Scholar, sidelining the OBR, and challenging the Bank’s independence. The Bank may have “presided over the drift of economic policy in Britain for 30 years”, but Truss still craved its endorsement. “Given the lukewarm nature of their public statements, which implicitly accepted the criticisms made by our opponents, it is unsurprising that the markets were unconvinced,” she writes. Threadneedle Street is also castigated for having “deliberately cast us adrift” by refusing to issue a full assessment of the economic effects of the mini-budget. However, the Bank has no formal role in reviewing tax and spending decisions – a function left to the OBR, which Truss had sidelined – and normally passes minimal comment on them. It would also have been a challenge when, according to Bailey, it was cut out of the loop and left “blindsided” by her mini-budget plans. The Office for Budget Responsibility Britain has grown to “defer to the revered cult of the technocrat”, Truss writes, with the OBR and the Treasury the pinnacle in a Whitehall establishment full of leftwing “quangocrats” reliant on flawed economic models. Truss may have valid criticism of the OBR’s forecasting record. It has been consistently wrong. But usually because it has been over optimistic . However, the main tax and spending constraints are not set by the OBR but by parliament – to which it is accountable. After the OBR’s establishment under George Osborne, Truss says the agency “developed a life of its own and now essentially sets fiscal policy”. “I’m not aware of any other Treasury anywhere in the world with such a rigid and inflexible arrangement.” Her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, could have changed the fiscal rules dictating how much Britain can borrow – a scorecard the OBR is only responsible for marking, not setting. After all, the UK’s fiscal rules have been changed more frequently than in almost any other advanced economy . But this did not happen.\n",

      "The European Commission has taken a significant step toward mending one of the most contentious fractures left by Brexit—restricted mobility between the UK and the European Union. In a landmark proposal, the Commission announced its intention to negotiate a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people aged 18 to 30 from both the UK and EU member states to live, work, and study in each other’s countries for up to four years. This move represents a notable shift in the EU’s stance, which had previously resisted concessions to the UK following its departure from the bloc.    The proposal, which still requires approval from EU leaders, could mark a turning point in post-Brexit relations, fostering closer ties between the next generation of Europeans and Britons. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen framed the initiative as a natural progression following the Windsor Framework, which eased tensions over Northern Ireland’s trade arrangements. \"Our relationship has become more constructive,\" she noted, emphasizing that youth mobility would serve mutual interests by strengthening cultural and professional bonds.    Under the envisioned agreement, participants would not be restricted to a single purpose—whether work, study, or travel—and would not face quotas, a departure from the rigid constraints of traditional visa systems. However, conditions such as proof of financial stability and health insurance would apply, mirroring similar schemes in countries like Canada and Australia. The proposal also hints at restoring reciprocal tuition fee arrangements, potentially ending the exorbitant overseas fees that have deterred many students from crossing the Channel.    The hospitality and academic sectors, both of which have struggled with labor shortages since Brexit, stand to benefit significantly. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, welcomed the proposal, calling it a long-overdue solution to staffing crises in restaurants, hotels, and seasonal industries. Meanwhile, universities on both sides could see a resurgence in research collaboration, particularly under programs like Horizon Europe, which has suffered from the UK’s diminished participation.    Sweden, a vocal advocate for the scheme, has championed the initiative as a win for young Europeans and Britons alike. Jessika Roswall, Sweden’s Minister for European Affairs, underscored the importance of rebuilding educational and cultural exchanges that were disrupted by Brexit. \"This is about securing opportunities for the next generation,\" she said, reflecting a broader sentiment among EU nations that see youth mobility as a bridge rather than a concession.    The UK government, while cautious not to frame the proposal as a reversal of Brexit’s core principles, has signaled openness to the idea. Officials point to existing bilateral agreements, such as those between France and Canada, as proof that controlled mobility can coexist with national immigration policies. Lord Kinnoull, chair of the House of Lords European Affairs Committee, praised the development, arguing that such a program would deliver \"immense mutual benefits\" without undermining sovereignty.    Critics, however, warn that the scheme could reignite debates over immigration control—a central issue in the Brexit referendum. The Commission has been careful to stress that the proposal does not equate to reinstating free movement, emphasizing time limits and eligibility checks. \"This is not about granting UK citizens the same rights as EU nationals,\" a spokesperson clarified, \"but about creating structured opportunities for temporary exchange.\"    The broader implications of the proposal extend beyond labor markets and universities. By reestablishing personal connections between young Britons and Europeans, the scheme could soften the political and cultural estrangement that has defined recent years. Analysts suggest that fostering familiarity between the two populations may lay the groundwork for more cooperative relations in the future, particularly as a new generation of leaders emerges.    If approved, negotiations could begin as early as May, with EU ministers set to discuss the matter at their next meeting. While hurdles remain—including potential resistance from member states wary of immigration concessions—the fact that the Commission has put forward the proposal signals a willingness to explore pragmatic solutions. For millions of young people who grew up with the ease of pre-Brexit mobility, the scheme offers a glimmer of hope that some of those lost opportunities might be restored.    As discussions progress, the focus will likely shift to the finer details: Will participating countries impose additional restrictions? How will tuition fee reciprocity be implemented? And crucially, will the UK’s political climate allow for such an agreement without backlash? For now, the proposal stands as one of the most tangible efforts to repair the rift caused by Brexit—one that, if successful, could redefine the relationship between Britain and Europe for decades to come.\n",
      "Статья 2:\n",
      "The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of 18- to 30-year-olds in a major concession. It said it would now seek approval from individual EU leaders to start the talks, which could partly eliminate one of the most controversial elements of Brexit, a block on the right to live in one another’s countries, albeit for a limited period and with conditions. Referring to the post-Brexit trading agreement on Northern Ireland, the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Since we have the Windsor agreement in place, the relationship has been much more constructive. “There are certainly topics where we can have closer collaboration … and the topic of youth mobility is in both our interests because the more we have youth mobility being on both sides of the channel, the more we increase the probability we will be on good terms because the next generation knows each other very well.” Under the envisaged agreement, EU and UK citizens aged between 18 and 30 would be able to stay for up to four years in the destination country, the European Commission said in a detailed statement. If agreed, a youth mobility scheme visa would be issued in those countries that participate, with possible conditions including a requirement for health insurance and proof of sufficient subsistence funds, a feature of other mobility schemes around the world. “The objective would be to facilitate youth exchanges, making it easier for young EU citizens to travel, work and live in the UK, with reciprocity for young UK nationals in a member state,” the commission said . The decision by the commission, which has in the past been vehemently opposed to making any concessions to the UK sought since Brexit, is seen as a breakthrough in UK-EU relations. The proposal to open negotiation must first be agreed by EU leaders. Sources say the first opportunity could arise in May at a meeting of general affairs ministers. If approved, it would mean millions of young people could come to the UK to fill the gap left by Brexit in the hospitality sector, and also in universities. It would mean seasonal work, from restaurant work to jobs in ski resorts, would be available again to British young people in EU countries. It may also make it easier for UK and EU universities to recruit researchers, particularly those involved in the Horizon science research programme. Under the scheme it is also envisaged that the university student home-fee system would be restored in both directions, ending the crippling overseas fees which sometimes amounted to more than £40,000 a year. The Swedish minister for European affairs, Jessika Roswall, told the Guardian: “Sweden has pushed for this and we feel this is very important for the youth and students in the EU and the UK, they are the winners.” In its announcement, thecommission said it had acted after the UK had made approaches to individual EU countries, known to include France, to open a youth mobility scheme. UK ministers have argued that it would not be a backtracking on one of the key elements of Brexit, the end of free movement for British citizens. They argued that France already had such an agreement with Canada, and Australia had a similar deal with the UK, and that it would be an important way to foster cultural exchange for future generations. “Mobility would not be purpose-bound, ie beneficiaries should be able to undertake different activities during that period, such as studying, training, working or travelling, neither would mobility be subject to a quota system,” said the commission. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said: “We have been calling for these schemes to be expanded and I’m pleased to see the EU Commission coming to the table with a plan to open negotiations. I hope the EU Council agrees with the proposal and that talks between the UK and EU can begin as soon as possible.” The commission’s statement raises a possibility that it could pave the way for university places in one another’s countries if member states and the UK saw fit. And agreement “would also provide for equal treatment (ie, non-discrimination) between EU and UK citizens in respect of higher education tuition fees”, the statement said. The commission stressed that a youth mobility scheme would not be reinstating free movement as it would come with conditions including a limited stay in one another’s countries. “The envisaged agreement would provide for limited-in-time mobility, subject to the fulfilment of conditions to be checked before the mobility can take place. The conditions should also be met during the stay. It is not about conferring to young UK nationals the benefits of the fundamental freedom of movement enjoyed by EU citizens,” it said. It added that Brexit had particularly “affected the opportunities for young people to experience life on the other side of the channel and to benefit from youth, cultural, educational, research and training exchanges”. It also said that a bloc-wide deal was preferable to a series of bilaterals as it would ensure equal treatment for every person in the scheme. Lord Kinnoull, the chair of the House of Lords European affairs committee, which recommended such a mobility programme, welcomed the development, saying if agreement was reached it would be “greatly to the mutual benefit of both parties and to the youth of Europe”.\n",

      "The political landscape in the UK has been rocked by a series of high-profile developments, spanning financial investigations, climate policy reversals, and growing tensions over campaign funding allegations. These events have unfolded against a backdrop of shifting public opinion, with new polling data suggesting a significant lead for Labour over the Conservatives on key policy issues—including, for the first time in years, national security.    **Peter Murrell Re-Arrested in SNP Finances Probe**   In a dramatic turn of events, Peter Murrell, the former chief executive of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and husband of ex-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been rearrested in connection with an ongoing police investigation into the party’s finances. Murrell, 59, was initially arrested in April 2023 and was taken into custody again early this morning. Police Scotland confirmed the arrest, urging the public to exercise caution in discussing the case due to its active legal status.    The investigation, which has cast a long shadow over the SNP, centers on allegations of financial mismanagement and potential misuse of party funds. Legal experts suggest that the rearrest signals a deepening of the probe, possibly indicating new evidence or lines of inquiry. A spokesperson for the SNP declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Meanwhile, political analysts speculate that the case could have far-reaching implications for the party’s leadership and electoral prospects, particularly as it grapples with internal divisions and declining poll numbers.    **Conservative Party Faces Pressure Over MP’s Alleged Misuse of Funds**   Elsewhere, the Conservative Party is under mounting scrutiny after Labour leader Keir Starmer called for allegations involving MP Mark Menzies to be referred to the police. Menzies, who represents Fylde in Lancashire, is accused of misusing campaign funds, with reports suggesting that a whistleblower raised concerns with Chief Whip Simon Hart three months ago.    Conservative Party sources confirm that an internal inquiry is underway but have resisted calls to involve law enforcement at this stage. They argue that the initial approach from the whistleblower did not constitute a formal complaint, though critics dismiss this as semantic evasion. Menzies has strongly denied the allegations, but the controversy has intensified pressure on Rishi Sunak’s government, already struggling with declining public trust.    Political ethics experts warn that failure to act decisively could further erode confidence in Westminster. \"Transparency is crucial in these matters,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a governance specialist at the University of London. \"If there’s credible evidence of wrongdoing, it should be investigated independently—not just internally.\"    **Scotland Scraps Key Climate Target, Sparking Outrage**   In a move that has drawn fierce criticism from environmental groups, the Scottish government has abandoned its legally binding target to cut carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. Net Zero Secretary Màiri McAllan admitted the goal was now \"out of reach,\" blaming insufficient policy support from Westminster and global economic challenges.    The decision has been branded the \"worst environmental decision in the history of devolution\" by campaigners. Imogen Dow of Friends of the Earth Scotland accused ministers of betraying future generations, while Professor Piers Forster of the UK’s Climate Change Committee called the reversal \"deeply disappointing.\"    Despite the backlash, First Minister Humza Yousaf insisted that Scotland’s commitment to achieving net zero by 2045—five years ahead of the UK target—remains unchanged. However, critics argue that without interim milestones, the long-term goal risks becoming unenforceable.    **Labour Gains Ground in Polls, Even on Defence**   New polling data from Lord Ashcroft reveals a striking shift in public opinion, with Labour now leading the Conservatives on every major policy issue—including defence, traditionally a Tory stronghold. Just 15% of voters said they would trust Rishi Sunak over Keir Starmer in the event of a national security crisis, a finding that has sent shockwaves through Conservative ranks.    The poll underscores the broader challenges facing Sunak’s government, which has struggled to regain momentum amid economic stagnation and internal party strife. With Labour consistently ahead in national surveys, political strategists suggest the Conservatives may need a radical reset to avoid a landslide defeat in the next general election.    **UK Considers Crackdown on Tech Investments in Hostile States**   In a bid to bolster national security, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has announced that the government is considering measures to prevent British firms from funding emerging technologies in countries deemed hostile. The move, which could target sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, reflects growing concerns over foreign espionage and technological warfare.    Security analysts warn that the UK must strike a delicate balance between protecting its interests and maintaining global economic ties. \"Overly restrictive measures could stifle innovation,\" said Dr. Jonathan Briggs, a defence policy expert. \"But unchecked investment in adversarial nations poses real risks.\"    **Inheritance Tax Loopholes Under Scrutiny**   A\n",

      "6.21pm BST Thank you for following developments today. We are now closing this blog, you can read all our UK politics coverage here . 5.33pm BST Afternoon summary Peter Murrell, the former Scottish National party chief executive and husband of the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been rearrested in connection with Police Scotland’s investigation into the party’s finances. The Conservative party is resisting calls from Keir Starmer for allegations that campaign funds were misused by the MP Mark Menzies to be referred to the police. (See 5.21pm .) The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of 18- to 30-year-olds in a major concession . Climate campaigners have accused Scottish ministers of being “inept” and “short-termist” after they scrapped Scotland’s target to cut carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. It would be wrong to attribute the UK’s wealth and economic success to its colonial history or racial privilege, the business and trade minister, Kemi Badenoch, has said. Updated at 5.35pm BST 5.21pm BST Conservative party HQ resists calls to refer Mark Menzies allegations to police The Conservative party has not responded to Labour’s question about whether it has referred the Mark Menzies allegation to the police and it has certainly not announced that the police are being called in. It has also declined to respond to all the other questions raised by Labour. (See 10.52am and 2.24pm .) But party sources have confirmed that an investigation into Menzies is under way. It is understood that a whisteblower approached Simon Hart, the chief whip, three months ago, and the matter was referred to CCHQ. Initially the whistleblower did not want Menzies to know that concerns had been raised. An inquiry only started when the whistleblower was happy for it to go ahead. Sources say there is a lot of information to process and the inquiry is still going ahead. They suggest that whether or not there is a referral to the police will depend on the outcome. The party maintains that the original approach from the whistleblower did not amount to a “complaint”. But this sounds like semantics. On the basis of what the Times is alleging, it has hard to see how this would not have sounded like a complaint. Menzies says he strongly disputes the allegations that have been made. 5.17pm BST Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell re-arrested by police over probe into SNP's finances Peter Murrell, former SNP chief executive and husband of ex-first minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been re-arrested in connection with the police investigation into the party’s finances, PA Media reports. PA says the 59-year-old was previously arrested on 5 April last year in the same investigation and was taken into custody this morning. Police Scotland said in a statement: A 59-year-old man has today, Thursday, 18 April 2024, been re-arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party. The man, who was previously arrested as a suspect on 5 April 2023, was taken into custody at 9.13am and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives. The matter remains active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the public are therefore advised to exercise caution if discussing it on social media. As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further at this time. 4.55pm BST Scottish government accused of 'worst environmental decision in history of devolution' after 2030 emissions target dropped Holyrood ministers have been accused of making the “worst environmental decision in the history of devolution” as the Scottish government abandoned a key climate change target, PA Media reports. Environmental campaigners hit out after Scottish net zero secretary Màiri McAllan conceded the goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030 is now “out of reach”. With the target enshrined in law, the Scottish government – which includes the Greens thanks to a powersharing agreement with the SNP – will now bring forward new legislation to ensure climate change targets “better reflect the reality of long-term climate policymaking”, McAllan told MSPs. This will also see the Scottish government move away from legally-binding annual targets – which it has missed for eight out of 12 years. But McAllan stressed Scotland’s target to reach net zero by 2045 – five years earlier than the UK – will remain. Humza Yousaf had earlier told MSPs his government will “not move back by a single month, a week or even a day from that 2045 target”. Prof Piers Forster, interim chairman of the UK’s Climate Change Committee , said the removal of the 2030 target is “deeply disappointing”. Friends of the Earth Scotland ’s head of campaigns Imogen Dow said: SNP and Green ministers choosing the scrap these climate commitments is the worst environmental decision in the history of the Scottish parliament. The 2030 target could and should have been met, but instead politicians are going to break their promises and betray both their constituents and the most vulnerable people already enduring the impacts of climate breakdown. 4.38pm BST A reader asks: Do the Conservatives have the kind of rules that I believe Labour do, which would mean that MPs who have had the whip withdrawn will not be standing as Conservative candidates unless it’s restored before an election is called? Yes, they do. 4.07pm BST Labour ahead of Tories on all key issues, including defence, poll suggests The Ipsos poll out today (see 10.15am and 11.56am ) is not the only one out today providing a grim read for No 10. Lord Ashcroft , the former Tory deputy chair and Angela Rayner biographer, has for years run a well-regarded polling operation, and his latest poll shows Labour ahead of the Conservatives on every issue of importance to voters, including defence. In an article on the findings, Ashcroft writes: In a survey just under a year ago I found that defence and national security was the one area in which the Conservatives were still trusted more than Labour. As the world seems to become more unstable by the week, and with UK forces taking part in an operation to shoot down Iranian drones, might these issues come to play a bigger part in people’s voting decisions, to the Tories’ advantage? There is certainly evidence that defence is on the minds of more voters. Only 8% named it among the top three issues facing the country a year ago, compared to 13% today. But four times as many mention the cost of living and even more name the NHS. In any case, the Conservatives should not expect a dividend if national security is climbing the political agenda. My latest poll now finds Labour to be ahead on the issue, for the first time I can remember in my years of polling. Only 28% of voters think Labour would do a better job on defence, but the Tories languish on 26%, with nearly half of voters saying they don’t know. In the event of an armed conflict that threatened the UK, only just over one in five say they would trust Keir Starmer more than Rishi Sunak to lead and make good decisions, but only 15% say the reverse. Sir Keir is hardly the new Sir Winston, but defence is not the firm Tory territory it once was. It is not just the poll numbers that will worry Rishi Sunak; he will be even more worried about the fact that the Daily Mail, which is normally reliably pro-Tory, made the story its splash.

Kiran Stacey has the story here. Related: UK firms may be barred from funding emerging tech in hostile countries Updated at 3.51pm BST 3.34pm BST IFS says closing 3 inheritance tax loopholes could raise almost £4bn a year by end of decade Labour has announced only a very small number of measures to increase the amount it would raise through tax and none of them affect what might be described as taxes paid by ordinary people. But Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has in the past suggested that she might raise more by closing “loopholes”, and she so is likely to take a close interest in a report published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today saying the government could raise almost £3bn by closing three inheritance tax loopholes. It says removing business relief for AIM (Alternative investment market) shares could raise £1.1bn this year; capping agricultural and business relief at £500,000 per person would raise £1.4bn; and including the value of defined contribution pensions in estates would raise £200m. By 2029-30 those measures would raise almost £4bn a year (£1.6bn, £1.8bn and £400m respectively), it says. David Sturrock, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies , said: Inheritance tax is littered with special reliefs and exemptions which make the tax unfair. The spring budget introduced yet another relief to this long list. Rather than gradually carving out more and more assets from the tax, the government should take steps to reduce or eliminate some of the major exemptions in the system. Eliminating the special treatment given to some shares, capping reliefs for business and agricultural assets, and bringing pension pots into the scope of the tax would make the system fairer and raise revenues. 3.12pm BST Kemi Badenoch says UK's wealth does not come from colonialism or white privilege It would be wrong to attribute the UK’s wealth and economic success to its colonial history or racial privilege, the business and trade minister, Kemi Badenoch , has told an audience in the City. Kalyeena Makortoff has the story here. Related: Kemi Badenoch: UK’s wealth isn’t from white privilege and colonialism 2.46pm BST Starmer restates 'complete confidence' in Rayner In his interview clip for broadcasters, Keir Starmer also restated his “complete confidence” in Angela Rayner. And he said the fact there is now a police investigation into issues relating to a house purchase and Rayner’s living arrangements before she became an MP should “draw a line” under the affair. Asked if he still had complete faith in his deputy, Starmer replied: Angela has answered no end of questions on this. She’s said she’s happy to answer any further questions. I have complete confidence in her and the police investigation, I think, allows a line to be drawn in relation to this. By “allows a line to be drawn” etc, Starmer seemed to be saying that he thought the fact that the police are investigating should put a stop to the need for any further media comment until the inquiry is over. He also said Rayner would be out with the party campaigning in the local elections. Updated at 2.47pm BST 2.31pm BST 2.24pm BST Starmer calls for police investigation into Mark Menzies allegations Keir Starmer has called for the police to launch an inquiry into some of the allegations made by a Times story that has led to Mark Menzies MP being suspended from the Conservative party. Asked for his response to the report, Starmer told broadcasters: There are obviously a lot of unanswered questions in relation to these allegations, not least why it seems the Conservative party took so long to act and whether they’ve reported this to the police, who it seems to me should be involved in this. Starmer also claimed the Menzies allegations showed why voters should “turn the page on this shower and have a fresh start with Labour”. He said: We’re two weeks away from really important local and mayoral elections when you know there’s a lot of positive arguments that we want to make about the change we can bring about elections. And yet again we’re talking about misbehaviour by Tory MPs. If ever you needed evidence of why we need to turn the page on this shower and have a fresh start with Labour, I think it’s in these allegations coming out today. Labour has already sent a letter to Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, challenging him to provide answers to a whole series of questions raised by the Times story about Menzies. (See 12.31pm .) For the record, here are the questions from that Labour leader, sent by Anneliese Dodds , the party chair. The Conservative party has reportedly been aware of these serious accusations for over three months. What action was taken, by whom, and when? When did CCHQ become aware of this incident? On being made aware of this incident, did CCHQ advise the person involved to contact the police themselves? When presented with evidence of an MP involving junior staff in paying thousands of pounds to ‘bad people’, did you immediately report this matter to the police? And if you have not yet, why not and will you do so today? Will you give the police full access to all evidence you have in this case? At least one of Menzies’ donors is reported to have given a “four-figure sum” to the Fylde group. Has this been declared with the Electoral Commission? Is it common practice for Conservative party MPs to use money donated for campaigning activities to instead pay their personal expenses? According to the Conservative party constitution, the board of the Conservative party is responsible for the Conservative party’s compliance with PPERA [Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act]. As chairman of the Conservatives, you chair the board in the absence of Rishi Sunak. Can you confirm that you and the board have completely satisfied your obligations under PPERA? Can you further confirm that the Conservative party are fully compliant with all relevant UK electoral and donations law? In a statement about the allegations, first report by the Times, Menzies said: I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further. Updated at 2.34pm BST 1.45pm BST Quarter of Tory voters think Angela Rayner story 'sounds like smear', poll suggests Around a quarter of Conservative supporters believe the row about Angela Rayner’s housing arrangements before she became an MP “sounds like a smear campaign”, according to new polling . The Savanta polling, commissioned by the pro-Labour website LabourList, found that amongst the population as a whole 40% of people say the story sounds like a smear. Amongst Labour voters that figure is 56%, and amongst Tory voters that figure is 26%. Tom Belger , editor of LabourList, said: Labour has attacked rightwing ‘smears’ against Angela Rayner, and this poll suggests a striking number of Tory and Labour voters alike agree there are political reasons this story is getting so much attention. Updated at 1.45pm BST 1.34pm BST Pupil suspensions in England hit record high, rising by nearly a third year on year, DfE figures show The number of pupil suspensions in England has risen by nearly a third in a year to more than 260,000, PA Media reports. PA says: Data from the Department for Education (DfE) shows there were 263,904 suspensions in the spring term of 2022/23, compared to 201,090 during the spring term of 2021/22 – a rise of 31%. The number of suspensions in spring 2023 is the “highest” termly figure recorded, the DfE said. Suspensions are typically higher in the autumn term, but the figures show the number rose by 7% from autumn 2022 (when there were 247,366 suspensions) to spring 2023. The rise of suspensions – which are when a pupil is excluded from a school for a set period of time – comes amid warnings of challenging behaviour in classrooms following the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of permanent exclusions also increased in the spring term of last year compared to the same period in 2022. There were 3,039 permanent exclusions in spring 2023, compared to 2,179 in spring 2022 – a rise of 39%, the figures show. The most common reason for suspensions and permanent exclusions was persistent disruptive behaviour, the DfE said. 1.25pm BST In the Commons William Wragg, the MP who recently resigned the Tory whip after admitting divulging colleagues’ phone numbers to a stranger threatening him on WhatsApp, had been due to open a backbench debate on access to redress schemes, according to the Commons order paper. But he did not speak, and the Lib Dem MP Richard Foord opened the debate instead. He said compensation schemes like those for victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal were “frequently blighted by unnecessary complexity, delays [and] a huge emotional and legal burden on the victims”. Redress schemes should be “effective, timely, proportionate and fair”, he argued. 1.14pm BST No 10 says it hopes to end Commons/Lords deadlock on Rwanda bill on Monday night During questions in the Commons on next week’s business, Penny Mordaunt , leader of the house, said that MPs would debate the latest Lords amendments to the Rwanda bill on Monday and that, if necessary, time would also be set aside on Tuesday for MPs to vote again on Lords amendments to the bill. But, at the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists that the government wants to conclude the “ping pong” process (when the bill shuttles between the Commons and the Lords until both sides agree on its wording) on Monday night. He said: Our intention is to get this passed on Monday such that we can then set out the timetable for getting flights off as soon as possible. Downing Street is prepared, if necessary, for the Commons and the Lords to sit late into the night until the deadlock is broken. Ultimately, the Lords almost always does back down, but sometimes peers might send a bill back to the Commons up to about five times in the hope of getting ministers to “think again” and grant concessions. When the Lords first debated the Rwanda bill, they inserted 10 amendments that were later removed by MPs. Since then, rather than accept the government version, peers have now sent the bill back to the Commons three times with changes opposed by the government. The last debate was last night, when peers dug their heels in on just two issues. Related: Rwanda bill further delayed after Lords again votes for changes At the lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson indicated that the government would not be making any further concessions on the bill. But the spokesperson did not offer a clear explanation as to why MPs were not debating the bill again until Monday afternoon. It had been expected that they might debate it again late last night, or today. 12.31pm BST Anneliese Dodds , the Labour party chair, has written an open letter to Richard Holden, her Tory counterpart, raising questions over his party’s handling of the allegations about Mark Menzies. As PA Media reports, Dodds said the allegations raised “extremely serious questions relating to potential criminality” and asked whether the matter had been or would be reported to the police. She also asked when the Conservative party had become aware of the allegations, what action had been taken and whether it was “common practice for Conservative party MPs to use money donated for campaigning activities to instead pay their personal expenses”. She wrote: A long-serving Tory worker involved in this disturbing incident says they believe the Conservative party wants to ‘brush it under the carpet’. I trust you will now take all steps to show this is not the case. In a statement about the allegations, first report by the Times, Menzies said: I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further. 12.25pm BST Mark Menzies suspended from role as unpaid trade envoy to Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, No 10 says Mark Menzies MP has been suspended from his role as one of Rishi Sunak’s envoys following allegations he misused campaign funds, PA Media reports. At the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokeperson said Menzies had been suspended from the unpaid, voluntary role aimed at boosting trade with Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina. Updated at 12.36pm BST 11.56am BST The polling company Ipsos has now published online the charts accompanying the polling it released today showing Rishi Sunak’s approval rating at a record low. (See 10.15am .) Here is the chart comparing Sunak’s ratings with other prime ministers’. And here is the chart comparing Keir Starmer’s ratings with other opposition leaders’. It shows that, compared to other opposition leaders at the same point after their election, Starmer is doing a lot better than Jeremy Corbyn, a lot worse than David Cameron and Neil Kinnock, and about the same as Ed Miliband and William Hague on this measure. Those final three words in the paragraph above are important. On the net satisfaction measure, Starmer is only average as opposition leader. But if you judge him by how popular his party has become under his leadership (a more relevant measure if you care about election results), Starmer is doing far better than any opposition leader since Tony Blair. 11.35am BST Neil Gray , the Scottish government’s health secretary, has welcomed the decision of two health boards – one of which covers the only gender clinic in the country for young people – to pause the prescription of puberty blockers to new patients, PA Media reports. PA says: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) and NHS Lothian said the decision came with the support of Scotland’s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Gregor Smith, following a review by Dr Hilary Cass in England and the same decision being taken south of the border. NHSGGC covers Scotland’s only gender clinic for under-18s while NHS Lothian provides care to those aged 17 and over at its Chalmers gender identity clinic. Gray said it was right for the decision to be made by clinicians rather than politicians, adding that the Scottish government and boards are considering the recommendations of the Cass Review. Updated at 4.08pm BST 11.22am BST Mordaunt says government won't change Commons procedure to allow all MPs to question Lord Cameron on foreign affairs During business questions Lucy Powell , the shadow leader of the Commons, also asked Penny Mordaunt why the government is refusing to change parliamentary rules to allow David Cameron, who sits in the Lords as foreign secretary, to be questioned by all MPs. After Cameron’s surprise appointment last year, Mordaunt initially suggested she was open to the idea of all MPs getting the chance to question Cameron, perhaps in Westminster Hall. In January the Commons procedure committee published a report proposing instead that all MPs should get the chance to question Cameron, and other secretaries of states who sit in the House of Lords, by allowing them to take questions at the bar of the Commons chamber (the line in the carpet near the entrance to the chamber, where non-MPs stand or sit if summoned to appear). But in its reponse to this report , which has just been published, the government has said it will not adopt this proposal. (It does not categorically reject the idea, but it argues the current arrangements work well, it claims letting MPs question ministers from the Lords at the bar of the Commons would create various practical problems, and it says it would welcome “further consideration” of the proposal.) Mordaunt told Powell that the government was going to stick to the current rules because MPs already have plenty of opportunity to question ministers about foreign policy. She said that, since Cameron was appointed foreign secretary, there have been eight ministerial statements on foreign policy, three prime ministerial statements on foreign policy, a debate on the situation in the Red Sea and 17 Westminster Hall debates on foreign policy, as well as the usual question time sessions. In its reponse to the procedure committee, the government said: Throughout its history, the Commons has called non-members to give evidence in various formats, and in living memory the preferred format for scrutiny of non-members has been via select committees. This is an arrangement that has worked well in facilitating Commons scrutiny of secretaries of state in the House of Lords, and Lord Cameron has already given evidence to select committees in the Commons since his appointment. By contrast, the use of the bar of the House for routine scrutiny of non-members is entirely untested. Indeed, there is no evidence yet brought forward that suggests any Peer has responded to routine scrutiny from members of parliament at the bar of the House of Commons. A lack of modern – or even historic – precedent does not mean that the Commons should not consider novel measures to achieve the level of scrutiny it demands. It does, however, demand thorough consideration of the potential consequences of such a procedural change. Updated at 11.23am BST 10.52am BST Labour says Tory response to Mark Menzies allegations 'too weak' and suggests they should be reported to police In the Commons Lucy Powell , the shadow leader of the Commons, asked Penny Mordaunt when the government first knew about the allegations against Mark Menzies. And she asked if the matter had been referred to the police. “If not, why not?” She went on: It seems that yet again, like with [William Wragg] and so many of the recent cases of sleaze and scandal, they’re too weak to act decisively and instead choose to brush things under the carpet. The truth is, they’ve given up on governing. In her response, Mordaunt , the leader of the Commons, did not refer directly to the Menzies case, but she said some “very serious allegations” had come to light during the Easter recess (she seemed to be referring primarily to the Wragg revelations] and she said she could not comment on them. Updated at 10.54am BST 10.15am BST Sunak's approval rating hits record low for a PM, poll suggests Rishi Sunak’s approval rating is at a record low for a prime minister in modern times, according to the polling company Ipsos. In its latest Political Monitor report it says net satisfaction with Sunak (% satisfied with how he is doing his job minus % dissatisfied) is now at -59. This matches John Major’s -59 score in August 1994, the record low for a prime minister in the Ipsos data going back to the 1980s. The record low for an opposition leader on net satisfication was the -60 that Jeremy Corbyn achieved in September 2019. Keir Starmer’s appoval rating has also fallen, although it is still a lot higher than Sunak’s. Ipsos says: Starmer’s ratings have also fallen since February. 25% are satisfied with his performance as Labour leader (-4) and 56% are dissatisfied (+1). His net score of -31 is his worst as Labour leader since he recorded a -29 in May 2021. Among Labour supporters, satisfaction with his performance has also dropped from 58% to 51%. Ipsos found that, when people were asked who would make the most capable PM, Starmer has a clear lead over Sunak. When presented with a head-to-head choice, the public think Keir Starmer would make the most capable prime minister over Rishi Sunak by a margin of 22 points (44% to 22%). 22% say neither and 10% don’t know. This is an increase in Keir Starmer’s lead since January (from 13 points to 22), and is similar to Starmer’s 20pt lead over Boris Johnson in July 2022. Although 2019 Conservative voters still prefer Sunak over Starmer by 49% to 20%. On voting intention, Ipsos has Labour on 44% (down 3 points from February), the Conservatives on 19% (down 1 point), Reform UK on 13% (up 5), and the Lib Dems on 9% (unchanged). Ipsos also found that none of the potential alternative Tory leaders it included in its survey were seen as capable of being a better PM than Starmer. It says: Nobody from a list of 6 potential alternative Conservative leaders stands out as doing particularly better versus Keir Starmer in a head-to-head contest Starmer leads each of the following as most capable PM: -Penny Mordaunt by 17 points (42% to 25%). 10% say neither and 22% don’t know. -James Cleverly by 29 points (47% to 18%). 11% neither. 24% don’t know. -Grant Shapps by 33 points (47% to 14%). 12% neither. 26% don’t know. -Kemi Badenoch by 34 points (48% to 14%). 9% say neither. 29% say don’t know. -Suella Braverman by 35 points (53% to 18%). 10% say neither and 19% don’t know. -Priti Patel by 35 points 9.51am BST 9.40am BST Grant Shapps attacks Labour over Rwanda bill and says RAF planes could be used for deportation Good morning. Yesterday Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, plonked himself on the moral high ground yesterday, issuing a statement attacking Keir Starmer for ignoring the “serious ethics scandal” around Angela Rayner. He is looking rather less principled today in the light of extraordinary allegations in the Times about Mark Menzies MP. 🔺 EXCLUSIVE: A Tory MP is under investigation over allegations that he misused campaign funds and abused his position after making a late-night phone call saying he’d been locked up by “bad people” who were demanding thousands of pounds | ✍️ @billykenber https://t.co/KRP4AS56C1 — The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) April 17, 2024 Our write-up of the story is here . According to Billy Kenber in the Times, CCHQ (which means Holden) knew about the Menzies allegations more than three months ago, but did not suspend him until the Times published his story. Menzies says he strongly disputes the allegations made in the story. Grant Shapps , the defence secretary, was on media round duties for the government this morning. He said that there should be a proper investigation into the allegations, but the Menzies sounded like “potentially somebody who’s quite troubled”. It is not clear if the story will move on much today, and for legal reasons there is a limit to how much we can say, and so the story won’t feature much in the blog today. If people start commenting on it directly BTL, comments may get closed. In his interviews, Shapps was also asked about the government’s Rwanda policy. The government had been hoping to get its Rwanda bill onto the statute book this week but last night the Lords voted again to insert two safeguards opposed by the Commons and, instead of getting MPs to vote again on the bill today, ministers have postponed the next debate until next week. Related: Rwanda bill further delayed after Lords again votes for changes In his Times Radio interview, Shapps claimed that this showed Labour did not want the bill to pass, and that it wanted small boat arrivals to continue. He said: Labour have once again locked the ability for parliament to pass this law. Labour don’t seem to have an answer [to the small boat problem], they don’t seem to want it [the Rwanda policy] to happen. It’s directly at Keir Starmer’s door if they don’t go [ie, if asylum seekers are not send to Rwanda]. Labour sources say they do expect the bill to become law, and that it could have become law this week if ministers had scheduled more “ping pong” debates last night or today. In his interviews Shapps also confirmed that RAF planes could be used for deportation flights to Rwanda. As PA Media reports, it is understood RAF Voyager aircraft could be deployed after the Home Office failed to find an airline that would charter the flights. Downing Street has drawn up plans to order the Ministry of Defence to repurpose at least one of the leased aircraft for this, according to The Times. Asked about this on Sky News this morning, Shapps said: We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get these flights off, whether they are charter flights or other kinds of flights. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, takes questions on the Commons. 10.15am: Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, speaks at the CityUK conference in London. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, gives a speech at Chatham House. 12pm: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions from MSPs at Holyrood. Afternoon: William Wragg, the MP who recently resigned the Tory whip after admitting divulging colleagues’ phone numbers to a stranger threatening him on WhatsApp, is due to speak in the Commons, opening a backbench debate on access to redress schemes. Afternoon: Màiri McAllan, the Scottish government’s climate minister, is due to make an announcement to MSPs ditching a greenhouse gas target for 2030. Also, Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and Ed Miliband are doing a visit today in the north-east of England to promote Labour’s plans for investments in ports. And David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is a the G7 foreign ministers’ summit on the Italian island of Capri. If you want to contact me, do use the “send us a message” feature.

      "The British government is weighing new measures to prevent UK investors from financing advanced technological projects in foreign nations deemed hostile, amid growing concerns that such investments could inadvertently strengthen adversaries' military and intelligence capabilities. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden outlined the potential policy shift in a speech at the Chatham House think tank, signaling a cautious but deliberate approach to safeguarding national security while maintaining the UK’s reputation as an open economy.    Dowden acknowledged that while only a small fraction of British overseas investments might pose security risks, even minimal financial flows could have outsized consequences if they accelerate technological advancements in adversarial states. \"There is a possibility that a very limited number of outbound investments could facilitate significant enhancements in cutting-edge capabilities that may ultimately harm the UK,\" he said. The proposed restrictions would focus on highly sensitive sectors—mirroring recent actions by the United States, which has already moved to block American funding in Chinese semiconductor, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence ventures.    When pressed on which countries might be targeted by these measures, Dowden pointed to China as the primary concern, describing it as the \"number one state-based threat to our economic security.\" However, he also emphasized that the policy would extend to other hostile regimes, including Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The announcement arrives at a delicate moment in UK-China relations, which have been strained by allegations of cyberattacks linked to Beijing and long-standing suspicions over Chinese technology firms like Huawei.    Despite these tensions, Dowden sought to strike a balance, insisting that the UK remains \"open for business\" and that investment restrictions would be narrowly tailored to avoid stifling legitimate economic activity. His remarks reflect a broader debate within Western governments about how to counter technological espionage and intellectual property theft without resorting to blanket economic decoupling.    One area of particular vulnerability, according to Dowden, is the higher education sector. British universities, renowned for their research in sensitive technologies, have increasingly relied on foreign funding—some of which originates from countries with questionable intentions. Recent reports have revealed collaborations between UK academics and institutions tied to the Chinese military, raising alarms about the potential militarization of civilian research.    In response, Dowden announced plans to convene university vice-chancellors for discussions on mitigating these risks. \"We must ensure that universities' reliance on foreign funding does not become a dependency that leaves them open to undue influence or coercion,\" he warned. The move underscores the government’s broader strategy of tightening oversight without alienating the academic community, which depends on international partnerships for innovation.    Experts in cybersecurity and international trade have welcomed the government’s cautious approach but warn that enforcement will be key. \"The challenge lies in distinguishing between benign research collaborations and those with dual-use potential,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. \"Overregulation could stifle scientific progress, but under-regulation could leave critical vulnerabilities exposed.\"    Meanwhile, business leaders have expressed concerns about the potential economic fallout. \"Any restrictions must be transparent and predictable to avoid deterring legitimate investors,\" argued Jonathan Reynolds, director of the Confederation of British Industry’s international trade division. \"The UK's strength lies in its ability to attract global capital, and we must not undermine that without clear justification.\"    As the government prepares to launch a formal consultation on the proposed investment controls, the debate over economic security versus openness is likely to intensify. With geopolitical tensions rising and technological competition accelerating, the UK faces a difficult balancing act—one that will shape its economic and strategic future for years to come.\n",
      "Статья 2:\n",
      "Ministers are considering blocking British investors from funding emerging technologies in hostile countries if they believe the technology could pose a threat to UK security, the deputy prime minister has said. Oliver Dowden said on Thursday the government would consult on curbing British investment abroad, after becoming concerned that money from the UK could be used to finance projects that could undermine national security. His comments come eight months after the Biden administration gave regulators the power to stop US investment in Chinese institutions in three sectors: semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. In a speech at the Chatham House thinktank, Dowden said: “A careful review of the evidence suggests that it’s possible that a very small proportion of outbound investments could present national security issues. Indeed, they might be fuelling technological advances that enhance military and intelligence capabilities of countries of concern.” He added: “We have a problem here that we should look at … in a very small number of very critical areas where we actually believe that outbound investment from the United Kingdom could facilitate significant enhancements in adversarial cutting-edge capability in a way that may be detrimental to the United Kingdom. “It is that sort of very precise area of intervention that we’re looking at.” Pushed to say which countries he would consider a risk, the deputy prime minister said: “We set out into the integrated review refresh that China was the number one state-based threat to our economic security. “So I’m not blind to the fact that a lot of this will relate to China but equally it will relate to hostile states such as Iran, Russia and North Korea.” Dowden’s speech comes at a sensitive time for UK-Chinese relations. The government has shifted its stance towards Chinese technology in recent years amid growing international concern that equipment supplied by companies such as Huawei could be used for espionage. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has attempted to reset fractious relations with Beijing in recent months, but that effort was dealt a blow last month when it emerged Chinese hackers were behind cyber-attacks on politicians and the Electoral Commission. Dowden said on Thursday: “Our open economy is being targeted by state-based actors and their proxies across our inbound and outbound investment flows, our imports and exports and academic collaborations.” But in contrast with the more hawkish US rhetoric on Chinese investment, he also insisted: “We are open for business and my priority and presumption will always be in favour of investment.” The deputy prime minister singled out universities as particularly at risk of being manipulated by foreign governments, both because their researchers were likely to be targets and because academic institutions were so open to international investment. Last month, the Financial Times revealed that academics at Imperial College London had worked with scientists at institutions linked to the Chinese military on research with potential military applications. Dowden said he was summoning university vice-chancellors for a briefing on the kinds of technological threat to guard against. “We should be proud that much of the cutting-edge development in sensitive technologies is happening at our universities,” he said but added this could be a security risk. “We must ensure that universities’ reliance on foreign funding does not become a dependency” through which they can be “influenced, exploited or even coerced”.\n",

       "'The Scottish government has unveiled ambitious proposals outlining how citizenship would function in an independent Scotland, drawing inspiration from Ireland’s inclusive model. First Minister Humza Yousaf presented the plans, which aim to simplify the citizenship process by removing mandatory tests and drastically lowering application fees—a stark contrast to the UK government’s stricter immigration policies. The announcement has reignited tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster, particularly over whether Scottish taxpayer funds should be allocated to preparations for potential independence.  \\n\\nThe document, part of the \"Building a New Scotland\" series initiated by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, advocates for a citizenship framework that would automatically grant Scottish nationality to individuals born abroad if at least one parent holds Scottish citizenship. This approach mirrors Ireland’s system, which has long been praised for its flexibility and inclusivity. Additionally, the paper suggests that passports issued by an independent Scotland would adhere to European Union standards, featuring the traditional burgundy red color—a symbolic nod to the nation’s aspirations of rejoining the EU.  \\n\\nYousaf emphasized the urgency of addressing Scotland’s demographic challenges, particularly its aging population, during a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh with refugees from Ukraine and Syria. He argued that a more welcoming citizenship policy would help attract and retain talent, bolstering the workforce and economic growth. Under the proposed system, individuals would automatically qualify for Scottish citizenship if they are British citizens residing in Scotland, were born in the country, have a parent who is a British citizen born in Scotland, or have lived in Scotland for at least a decade. While dual nationality would be permitted, individuals would retain the right to decline Scottish citizenship or renounce their British status if they choose.  \\n\\nThe First Minister acknowledged that some might prefer to keep their British citizenship, stating, \"It’s important to recognize that people will feel strongly about retaining their British identity, and we should respect that choice.\" However, he expressed hope that the vast majority would embrace Scottish citizenship, given its potential benefits, including restored EU membership rights such as freedom of movement. Although rejoining the EU is not guaranteed, the Scottish government has signaled its intent to pursue membership swiftly, a move that would significantly enhance the value of a Scottish passport.  \\n\\nThe proposals also include a new visa category for individuals with Scottish grandparents, facilitating easier access to citizenship for diaspora communities. Furthermore, the paper suggests that an independent Scotland could remain part of the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless movement for British and Irish citizens without border checks. This arrangement would maintain longstanding ties while allowing Scotland to forge its own immigration policies.  \\n\\nThe announcement has drawn criticism from political opponents, with Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, Neil Bibby, accusing Yousaf of being \"out of touch\" for prioritizing independence discussions amid a severe cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly rejected calls for a second independence referendum, leaving the Scottish National Party (SNP) to frame the next general election as a de facto vote on the issue.  \\n\\nAdding to the controversy, Simon Case, the UK’s top civil servant, recently raised concerns about Scottish government officials working on independence-related policies, calling it \"unusual and a bit worrying.\" Case indicated that new guidance would be issued to clarify the boundaries of civil servants\\' roles in constitutional matters. Yousaf dismissed these concerns, asserting that the legal basis for the independence papers was sound and accusing opposition parties of attempting to stifle democratic debate.  \\n\\nExperts have weighed in on the feasibility of the proposals, with some praising the ambition while cautioning about practical challenges. Dr. Fiona Hill, a political analyst at the University of Edinburgh, noted, \"The Irish model is an attractive blueprint, but Scotland would need to navigate complex negotiations with both the UK and the EU to realize these plans.\" Others have pointed to potential economic hurdles, particularly if Scotland faces resistance from Westminster in establishing its own immigration and border policies.  \\n\\nAs the debate intensifies, the Scottish government remains steadfast in its vision, framing independence as an opportunity to create a more equitable and globally connected nation. Whether these proposals gain traction will depend not only on political will but also on public sentiment as Scotland grapples with its future relationship with the UK and the wider world.'"

      "The Scottish government has unveiled ambitious proposals outlining how citizenship would function in an independent Scotland, drawing inspiration from Ireland’s inclusive model. First Minister Humza Yousaf presented the plans, which aim to simplify the citizenship process by removing mandatory tests and drastically lowering application fees—a stark contrast to the UK government’s stricter immigration policies. The announcement has reignited tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster, particularly over whether Scottish taxpayer funds should be allocated to preparations for potential independence.  The document, part of the \"Building a New Scotland\" series initiated by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, advocates for a citizenship framework that would automatically grant Scottish nationality to individuals born abroad if at least one parent holds Scottish citizenship. This approach mirrors Ireland’s system, which has long been praised for its flexibility and inclusivity. Additionally, the paper suggests that passports issued by an independent Scotland would adhere to European Union standards, featuring the traditional burgundy red color—a symbolic nod to the nation’s aspirations of rejoining the EU.  Yousaf emphasized the urgency of addressing Scotland’s demographic challenges, particularly its aging population, during a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh with refugees from Ukraine and Syria. He argued that a more welcoming citizenship policy would help attract and retain talent, bolstering the workforce and economic growth. Under the proposed system, individuals would automatically qualify for Scottish citizenship if they are British citizens residing in Scotland, were born in the country, have a parent who is a British citizen born in Scotland, or have lived in Scotland for at least a decade. While dual nationality would be permitted, individuals would retain the right to decline Scottish citizenship or renounce their British status if they choose.  The First Minister acknowledged that some might prefer to keep their British citizenship, stating, \"It’s important to recognize that people will feel strongly about retaining their British identity, and we should respect that choice.\" However, he expressed hope that the vast majority would embrace Scottish citizenship, given its potential benefits, including restored EU membership rights such as freedom of movement. Although rejoining the EU is not guaranteed, the Scottish government has signaled its intent to pursue membership swiftly, a move that would significantly enhance the value of a Scottish passport.  The proposals also include a new visa category for individuals with Scottish grandparents, facilitating easier access to citizenship for diaspora communities. Furthermore, the paper suggests that an independent Scotland could remain part of the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless movement for British and Irish citizens without border checks. This arrangement would maintain longstanding ties while allowing Scotland to forge its own immigration policies.  The announcement has drawn criticism from political opponents, with Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, Neil Bibby, accusing Yousaf of being \"out of touch\" for prioritizing independence discussions amid a severe cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly rejected calls for a second independence referendum, leaving the Scottish National Party (SNP) to frame the next general election as a de facto vote on the issue.  Adding to the controversy, Simon Case, the UK’s top civil servant, recently raised concerns about Scottish government officials working on independence-related policies, calling it \"unusual and a bit worrying.\" Case indicated that new guidance would be issued to clarify the boundaries of civil servants' roles in constitutional matters. Yousaf dismissed these concerns, asserting that the legal basis for the independence papers was sound and accusing opposition parties of attempting to stifle democratic debate.  Experts have weighed in on the feasibility of the proposals, with some praising the ambition while cautioning about practical challenges. Dr. Fiona Hill, a political analyst at the University of Edinburgh, noted, \"The Irish model is an attractive blueprint, but Scotland would need to navigate complex negotiations with both the UK and the EU to realize these plans.\" Others have pointed to potential economic hurdles, particularly if Scotland faces resistance from Westminster in establishing its own immigration and border policies.  As the debate intensifies, the Scottish government remains steadfast in its vision, framing independence as an opportunity to create a more equitable and globally connected nation. Whether these proposals gain traction will depend not only on political will but also on public sentiment as Scotland grapples with its future relationship with the UK and the wider world. \n",

      "The morning sun cast long shadows over Edinburgh’s historic streets as First Minister Humza Yousaf stepped up to the podium, flanked by Ukrainian and Syrian refugees who had found sanctuary in Scotland. Their presence was no accident—Yousaf’s announcement wasn’t just about policy, but people. \"A nation’s strength lies in its openness,\" he declared, unveiling plans for Scottish citizenship in an independent Scotland—a vision that could reshape the country’s identity and its place in the world.  At the heart of the proposal is a radical departure from Westminster’s approach. Gone would be the £1,500 naturalization fees and rigorous knowledge tests currently required for UK citizenship. Instead, Scotland would adopt Ireland’s inclusive model, automatically granting citizenship to children born abroad to Scottish parents and slashing fees to just £250—a move Yousaf argues is essential to address Scotland’s demographic crisis. \"We’re facing an aging population and workforce shortages,\" he told the room. \"This isn’t just about passports; it’s about securing our future.\"  The 42-page document, part of the SNP’s \"Building a New Scotland\" series, outlines a citizenship framework that would extend automatic eligibility to British citizens living in Scotland, those born there, or anyone with a decade of residency. Dual nationality would be permitted, though individuals could opt out—a provision Yousaf framed as respecting personal ties. \"Some will cherish their British identity, and that’s valid,\" he acknowledged. \"But imagine reclaiming EU freedom of movement, studying in Paris or working in Berlin without visas. That’s the opportunity we’re offering.\"  The symbolic details weren’t lost on observers: the proposed passport’s burgundy-red design, mimicking EU documents, sent a clear message about Scotland’s aspirations. Yet behind the optimism lie formidable obstacles. Dr. Fiona Hill, a University of Edinburgh political analyst, cautioned: \"Ireland’s system works because it’s backed by EU membership. Scotland would need to negotiate that first—and Westminster won’t make it easy.\"  Opposition voices were swift and sharp. \"Families are choosing between heating and eating, and Humza’s talking about passport colors?\" snapped Scottish Labour’s Neil Bibby. Meanwhile, in London, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case raised eyebrows by questioning whether civil servants should even be working on independence plans, calling it \"constitutionally questionable.\" Yousaf fired back: \"This is about preparing for democracy, not subverting it.\"  The diaspora provisions sparked particular interest, with a new grandparent visa route potentially reconnecting millions of Scottish descendants worldwide. Glasgow-born Canadian teacher Ewan MacLeod, 34, told us: \"My granny never stopped talking about home. If this happens, I’d apply in a heartbeat.\"  As the debate rages, one thing is clear: these proposals aren’t just administrative tweaks, but the foundation of a national identity in waiting. With the SNP framing the next UK election as a proxy independence vote, the question isn’t just whether Scotland could go it alone—but whether its people will embrace this vision of their future.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The Liberal Democrats are set to make a bold push to eliminate voter ID requirements, framing the policy as a deliberate attack on younger voters by the Conservative Party. The party plans to include this pledge in their upcoming election manifesto, arguing that the policy is not only expensive but also unnecessary, as it attempts to solve a virtually non-existent problem while disproportionately disenfranchising young people.  Since its introduction in May 2023 by the Conservative government, the voter ID law has mandated that all eligible voters present photo identification—such as passports, driving licenses, or certain travel cards—before casting their ballots in general, local, or police and crime commissioner elections. However, critics have pointed out glaring inconsistencies in the policy. While older voters can use 60-plus Oyster cards as valid ID, younger individuals are barred from using their own Oyster cards, raising concerns that the rules unfairly favor demographics more likely to vote Conservative.  The government justified the policy as a necessary measure to combat voter fraud, yet evidence suggests such incidents are exceedingly rare. In fact, the number of reported cases of impersonation fraud in recent elections has been negligible—just 33 allegations out of tens of millions of votes cast. Meanwhile, the policy has had unintended consequences, with many voters—particularly the elderly—being turned away at polling stations for lacking the correct identification. Even former Conservative cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted that the policy had backfired, acknowledging that older voters, a key Tory demographic, were among those most affected.  Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, has been vocal in her opposition, stating that her party will spearhead efforts to abolish the policy if they gain influence in the next parliament. \"We fought against voter ID at every stage in Parliament, and we will continue to do so,\" Cooper said. \"This is a costly, ineffective policy that does nothing but suppress voter turnout, especially among young people.\"  Cooper also linked the voter ID policy to a broader pattern of Conservative policies that she argues unfairly target younger generations. From proposals to reintroduce national service to the recent crackdown on so-called \"rip-off\" university degrees, she accused the Tories of using young people as \"political footballs\" in a desperate bid to rally their core supporters ahead of the election.  The financial burden of implementing voter ID has also come under scrutiny. Government estimates suggest the policy could cost up to £120 million over ten years—a sum that, according to the Liberal Democrats, could be far better spent. For example, that funding could provide mental health support for thousands through NHS Talking Therapy courses, addressing a critical need in a society where mental health services are already stretched thin.  Experts in electoral law have echoed concerns about the policy’s disproportionate impact. Dr. Sarah Birch, a professor of political science at King’s College London, noted that voter ID laws often create unnecessary barriers without improving electoral integrity. \"The evidence from other countries shows that strict ID requirements tend to reduce turnout among marginalized groups, including young people and minorities, without any corresponding benefit in terms of fraud prevention,\" she said.  As the debate intensifies, the Liberal Democrats are positioning themselves as the leading voice against what they see as an undemocratic and exclusionary policy. With the next general election on the horizon, the issue of voter ID is likely to remain a contentious battleground, shaping discussions around electoral fairness and the rights of younger voters.\n",

      "итоговая статья: Emma Thompson, a 19-year-old student from Manchester, arrived at her local polling station last May ready to cast her first ever vote—only to be turned away at the door. \"I had my student ID and my 18+ Oyster card, but they told me neither counted,\" she recalls, still frustrated months later. \"The poll worker said I needed a passport or driving license, which I don’t have. It felt like my voice didn’t matter.\"Stories like Thompson’s have become ammunition for the Liberal Democrats, who are preparing to launch an aggressive campaign to scrap voter ID requirements ahead of the next election. Party insiders confirm the pledge will feature prominently in their manifesto, with Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper calling it \"a solution in search of a problem\" that disproportionately silences young voters.Since the Conservative government implemented the policy in May 2023, voters across England have faced a patchwork of confusing rules. While pensioners can use their 60+ Oyster cards, younger Londoners’ transport cards are deemed invalid—a discrepancy that’s drawn sharp criticism. \"It’s hard not to see this as deliberate,\" says Dr. Sarah Birch of King’s College London. \"International data shows these laws typically depress turnout by 2-3% among groups like students and ethnic minorities.\"The government maintains the policy combats electoral fraud, though official records tell a different story. Just 33 cases of impersonation fraud were reported across tens of millions of votes in recent elections—a rate of 0.0001%. \"We’re spending millions to fix something that isn’t broken,\" Cooper told reporters last week, flanked by students at a Bristol sixth-form college. \"Meanwhile, elderly voters who’ve participated for decades are being turned away because they don’t drive anymore.\"Even within Conservative ranks, doubts have surfaced. Former Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg conceded last autumn that the policy had \"backfired spectacularly,\" noting that older Tory supporters were among those most affected. Yet Downing Street continues to defend the measure. A government spokesperson insisted: \"Showing ID is a reasonable expectation that brings Britain in line with most advanced democracies.\"The financial stakes are considerable. Treasury documents reveal the scheme could cost £120 million over a decade—enough to fund mental health therapy for 240,000 people through NHS Talking Therapies. \"That’s what real priorities look like,\" argues Thompson, the Manchester student, who’s since joined a youth voter registration drive.Critics see a broader pattern in recent Conservative policies affecting young people, from proposed national service revivals to restrictions on university degrees. \"First they made it harder for us to vote, now they’re telling us which degrees have value,\" says Ravi Patel, 21, a politics student at Leeds University. \"It feels like we’re being punished for not being their natural constituency.\"As election season approaches, polling stations may become flashpoints. The Electoral Commission reports over 14,000 voters were denied ballots in last year’s local elections due to ID issues—a figure likely to grow as awareness of the rules remains spotty. \"Nobody explained this to us at school,\" laments Thompson. \"How many others will show up next time just to be turned away?\"\n",

      "Статья до изменений: During a campaign visit to a pub in west Devon, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak found himself in an unexpected confrontation with a local teenager who boldly questioned his policies toward young people. Henry Hassell, a 16-year-old singer-songwriter, took the opportunity to challenge Sunak on his controversial proposal to reintroduce mandatory national service if the Conservatives win the upcoming election. The exchange, captured on video and later shared widely on TikTok and other social media platforms, quickly went viral, sparking heated debate about the government’s stance on youth engagement and civic duty.  Hassell, who has spent years volunteering in his community, directly asked the prime minister, \"Why do you hate young people so much?\" He went on to express frustration over the idea of being forced into military service or compulsory volunteering after completing his education. Sunak, attempting to reassure him, responded by emphasizing that participation would be optional, stating, \"You’ll have a choice… A culture of service is a good thing for our country.\" Unconvinced, Hassell dismissed the answer as \"waffling,\" a moment that resonated with many young viewers who felt similarly skeptical about the policy.  The proposed national service scheme, unveiled by Sunak last weekend, would require all 18-year-olds to either enlist in a full-time military placement or commit to monthly volunteer work in sectors like emergency response, healthcare, or infrastructure. The government has framed it as a way to foster discipline, community spirit, and national resilience. However, critics argue that the plan is poorly thought out, unfunded, and disproportionately targets disadvantaged communities.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently warned that the policy could deepen regional inequalities, undermining the government’s own \"levelling up\" agenda. Labour has seized on the controversy, accusing the Conservatives of pushing yet another uncosted pledge. A Labour spokesperson condemned the plan as \"a desperate, £2.5 billion unfunded commitment from a party that already crashed the economy.\" Behind the scenes, some Labour figures have suggested that the Tories are attempting to offload societal problems—such as military recruitment shortages and strained public services—onto young people rather than addressing systemic issues.  Hassell, reflecting on his exchange with Sunak, told reporters that he was unimpressed by the prime minister’s response. \"I thought he was trying to escape the question,\" he said, adding that many of his peers share his frustration. The teenager’s viral moment has amplified a growing sentiment among young voters who feel alienated by policies they perceive as punitive or dismissive of their aspirations.  Political analysts note that Sunak’s national service proposal may be an attempt to appeal to older, more conservative voters, but it risks further alienating a generation already disillusioned with politics. With youth turnout expected to play a decisive role in the next election, the backlash could prove costly for the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the prime minister’s office has yet to provide further clarification on how the policy would be implemented or funded, leaving many questions unanswered.  As the debate rages on, Hassell’s bold confrontation has become a symbol of youth resistance to top-down policies that fail to consider their voices. Whether Sunak’s national service plan will gain traction—or backfire spectacularly—remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: young people are no longer willing to stay silent.\n",

      "Статья до изменений: Keir Starmer has positioned himself as a leader who will govern from the center if he becomes the next prime minister, emphasizing that wealth creation is his top priority. In a wide-ranging interview with The Times, Starmer articulated his vision for a pragmatic and inclusive Labour Party, one that moves away from ideological extremes and focuses on economic growth as the foundation for national progress.  Starmer acknowledged that his stance on wealth creation might seem unusual for Labour, a party historically associated with redistribution and social justice. However, he argued that fostering prosperity is essential for improving living standards and funding public services. \"People want their families and their country to do better, and that means enabling businesses and individuals to succeed,\" he said. \"Economic growth isn’t just a slogan—it’s the engine that drives everything else.\"  His comments come amid a broader reshaping of the Labour Party, with critics accusing Starmer of sidelining left-wing figures in favor of centrist candidates. Recent controversies, including the deselection of Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Faiza Shaheen, as well as the uncertainty surrounding Diane Abbott’s candidacy, have fueled internal tensions. Abbott, a veteran MP, initially faced resistance from party officials but was later confirmed as a candidate after public pressure, including support from deputy leader Angela Rayner.  Starmer dismissed claims that his leadership is exclusionary, insisting that Labour must appeal to voters beyond its traditional base. \"I want a party that’s broad enough to welcome people who might not have considered themselves Labour supporters before,\" he said. \"This isn’t about tribalism—it’s about recognizing that most people want practical solutions, not ideological battles.\"  Political analysts suggest that Starmer’s approach reflects a deliberate strategy to distance Labour from the more radical policies of the Jeremy Corbyn era. \"Starmer is trying to reassure voters that Labour is fiscally responsible and pro-business,\" said Dr. Helen Carter, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. \"His emphasis on wealth creation is a direct appeal to middle-class voters who may have been alienated by past rhetoric.\"  Alongside his economic vision, Starmer is set to unveil Labour’s Back to Work plan, a comprehensive strategy aimed at reducing unemployment and improving job opportunities. The initiative includes reforms to the national careers service, greater autonomy for regional mayors in employment programs, and targeted support for young people and those with disabilities. \"Too many people are stuck in low-wage jobs or excluded from the workforce altogether,\" Starmer said. \"Labour will ensure that those who can work have the training and opportunities to do so.\"  Critics, however, argue that Starmer’s centrist shift risks alienating core Labour supporters. Trade union leaders and grassroots activists have expressed concerns that the party is abandoning its commitment to workers’ rights and economic equality. \"There’s a fine line between pragmatism and capitulation to corporate interests,\" said Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union. \"Labour must not forget its roots.\"  Despite these challenges, Starmer remains confident that his approach will resonate with voters. \"The country is ready for change,\" he said. \"But change has to be built on stability, growth, and a government that works for everyone—not just one faction or another.\"  As the general election approaches, Starmer’s ability to balance economic ambition with social justice will be crucial. His centrist pitch may well determine whether Labour can secure the broad coalition needed to unseat the Conservatives and return to power after more than a decade in opposition.\n"

      "Статья до обработки: The rolling hills of England’s countryside may soon become the unlikely battleground for Labour’s most ambitious tax reforms in decades. With the party poised for potential victory, shadow ministers are quietly drafting plans to overhaul Britain’s wealth taxes—measures that could reshape everything from family farms to City investment portfolios.At the heart of the proposals lies a dual approach: raising capital gains tax (CGT) rates and closing inheritance tax loopholes that have long benefited wealthy landowners. Internal Labour documents seen by the Guardian reveal these changes could generate £10 billion annually—funds desperately needed to shore up crumbling public services.\"Farmland shouldn’t be a tax avoidance vehicle for millionaires while nurses use food banks,\" argues Dr. Arun Advani, an economist at Warwick University whose research informed Labour’s plans. His 2022 study found agricultural relief allows landowners to avoid £700 million yearly in inheritance taxes—equivalent to building 10 new hospitals every decade.The proposed CGT increase would primarily affect higher earners, with analysis suggesting:- Basic-rate taxpayers: Minimal impact (current 10% rate may rise to 15-18%)- Higher-rate taxpayers: Significant jump (current 20% rate could reach 30-35%)- Additional-rate payers: Potentially facing 40-45% on investment gainsFor small business owners like Sarah Chen, who runs a Brighton café, the reforms bring both hope and anxiety. \"I support fair taxation,\" she says, wiping flour from her hands, \"but when my parents pass on this building, will I have to sell just to pay the taxman?\"Labour’s inheritance tax overhaul targets two key reliefs:1. Agricultural Property Relief (currently 100% exemption)2. Business Property Relief (up to 100% for qualifying assets)Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has proposed capping these at £500,000 per individual—or £1 million where both apply. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates this could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.Conservative critics warn of unintended consequences. \"This isn’t taxing the rich—it’s taxing family legacies,\" argues former Treasury minister David Gauke. He points to potential collateral damage: \"When farmers sell land to pay taxes, who buys it? Hedge funds and oligarchs.\"The seven-year gifting rule—which allows tax-free transfers if the donor lives seven years after giving—also faces scrutiny. Labour is considering reducing this window or implementing tapered relief, a move that tax experts say could recover £1.5 billion annually from estate planning strategies.Amid the technical debates, the human stakes remain clear. In Yorkshire, third-generation dairy farmer James Whitaker fears the changes: \"My great-grandfather bought these fields shilling by shilling. Now Whitehall wants 40% if I die?\" His 800-acre farm would face a £320,000 tax bill under the proposed cap.Yet urban reformers counter that such reliefs distort the market. \"Young farmers can’t compete when land prices are inflated by tax perks,\" notes Land Workers’ Alliance spokesperson Jyoti Fernandes. She cites cases where agricultural land sells for 30% above its farming value purely for tax advantages.The Office for Budget Responsibility has begun preliminary modelling at Labour’s request, though insiders caution final figures may shift. \"These are live consultations, not manifesto commitments,\" emphasizes a senior Labour adviser speaking anonymously. \"We’re being deliberately cautious because the Tories will weaponize any uncertainty.\"This tension between radical reform and electoral pragmatism runs through Labour’s preparations. While the leadership publicly rules out income tax hikes, Treasury specialists are reportedly modelling scenarios where CGT aligns with income tax rates—a move that could generate £14 billion but risk alienating middle-class voters.As autumn conference season approaches, the stage is set for Britain’s first serious wealth tax debate in a generation. Whether these proposals survive contact with political reality may determine not just Labour’s fiscal credibility, but the very shape of British capitalism in the 2020s. \n",

      "Итог обработки: Labour is preparing significant reforms to Britain's wealth taxation system, with proposals targeting capital gains and inheritance tax reliefs that currently benefit landowners and high earners. The plans, which could generate billions in additional revenue, are being developed as the party positions itself for a potential general election victory.Key measures under consideration include raising capital gains tax rates and limiting exemptions on agricultural and business assets passed through inheritance. Internal estimates suggest these changes could yield up to £10 billion annually, though final figures remain subject to Treasury modelling.The proposals focus on two main reliefs: Agricultural Property Relief, which currently provides 100% exemption on qualifying farmland, and Business Property Relief, offering similar benefits for business assets. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has floated capping these reliefs at £500,000 per individual, or £1 million where both apply—a move the Institute for Fiscal Studies projects could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.Economists point to research showing the current system allows substantial tax avoidance. A 2022 study by Warwick University's Dr. Arun Advani found agricultural relief alone enables landowners to avoid £700 million annually in inheritance taxes. \"The system creates distortions where land values become disconnected from productive use,\" Advani told the Guardian.Conservative critics warn the changes could have unintended consequences. Former Treasury minister David Gauke cautioned that forcing asset sales to cover tax bills might lead to consolidation by institutional investors rather than supporting family-run enterprises.Labour sources stress the proposals remain under consultation. \"We're evaluating all options carefully,\" said a senior party adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Any reforms will be designed to protect genuine small businesses while ensuring wealthier individuals pay their fair share.\"The Office for Budget Responsibility has begun preliminary assessments of the potential economic impact. Meanwhile, Treasury specialists are reportedly examining scenarios where capital gains tax rates align more closely with income tax bands—a change that could generate significant additional revenue but carries political risks.As policy development continues, the debate highlights broader questions about wealth distribution and tax fairness in Britain. The coming months will test whether Labour can translate these proposals into workable policies that balance revenue generation with economic and political realities.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The tranquil beauty of Fawley Meadows along the River Thames belies a growing crisis beneath its surface. On a breezy late spring day, Dave Wallace, a former open-water swimmer turned environmental activist, wades into the river’s murky waters with a sampling beaker in hand. The scene is picturesque—red kites circling overhead, the historic Henley Bridge framing the horizon—but Wallace knows better than to be fooled by appearances. His once-beloved swimming spot has become a battleground against pollution, a fight he never expected to join until a disturbing encounter two summers ago.  Wallace recalls the moment his perspective shifted. During the Henley to Marlow marathon swim, the river’s sluggish flow and unnerving clarity revealed an unsettling truth. \"The water was stagnant, and I could see brown streaks swirling around me,\" he says. \"It hit me—I was swimming in sewage. That was the day I stopped seeing the Thames as just a place for recreation and started seeing it as a victim.\" His shock turned to action. Now, armed with water quality data and a network of fellow activists, Wallace monitors sewage outflows, documents pollution events, and pressures authorities to address the crisis.  His story is far from unique. Along the Thames’ winding 215-mile journey from its source in the Cotswolds to the North Sea, a grassroots movement has emerged. Fishermen, scientists, retirees, and even former law enforcement officers have become unlikely guardians of the river, united by a shared alarm over its deteriorating health. Their efforts highlight a national scandal: decades of underinvestment, regulatory failures, and corporate negligence have turned England’s rivers into dumping grounds.   A River’s Decline: From Source to Sea  The Thames begins as a trickle at Trewsbury Mead, near Kemble, where limestone aquifers feed its nascent flow. Here, the water is still pure—a fact that makes its subsequent contamination all the more tragic. Chris Park, a local druid and meadmaker, describes the river’s origins with reverence. \"This water is like a newborn—untouched, life-giving,\" he says. \"Ancient cultures worshipped rivers because they understood their sacred role. We’ve forgotten that.\"  But just four miles downstream, in Fairford, the River Coln—one of the Thames’ key tributaries—bears the scars of neglect. Thames Water’s sewage treatment works here has become notorious for discharging untreated waste into the river, even long after heavy rainfall subsides. In early 2024, raw sewage flowed into the Coln for 44 consecutive days, a consequence of crumbling infrastructure overwhelmed by groundwater infiltration.  Andrew Doherty, a local councillor, shakes his head in disbelief. \"This is where the Thames begins, and yet we’re poisoning it before it even has a chance to grow,\" he says. \"We’re in the 21st century, and we’re still treating our rivers like open sewers.\"   The Alarming Reality of Sewage Dumping  Further downstream, near the medieval Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith stands by the confluence of the Thames and the Windrush. The latter, once a crystalline chalk stream teeming with aquatic plants and fish, now runs murky and lifeless. \"I fished here as a boy,\" Smith recalls. \"The gravel beds were clean, the water clear. Now, it’s just a grey sludge.\"  Smith’s frustration led him to investigate. Teaming up with Peter Hammond, a retired professor specializing in data analysis, he uncovered systematic illegal sewage dumping by Thames Water and other privatized utilities. Their research, presented to Parliament, revealed that the scale of unauthorized discharges was ten times higher than the Environment Agency’s estimates—a revelation that sparked a criminal investigation into over 2,000 treatment plants nationwide.  The numbers are staggering. In London alone, Thames Water discharged raw sewage into the Thames for 12,105 hours between 2023 and 2024—a fourfold increase from the previous year. At the Mogden treatment plant near Twickenham, 3.5 billion litres of untreated waste entered the river in 2020, equivalent to 1,400 Olympic swimming pools.   The Hidden Dangers: Beyond Raw Sewage  While raw sewage spills dominate headlines, treated effluent poses an equally insidious threat. Modern wastewater treatment removes solid waste but fails to eliminate harmful nutrients like phosphates and nitrates. These compounds fuel algal blooms, which deplete oxygen, choke aquatic life, and create dead zones.  James Wallace, CEO of River Action, explains the broader implications. \"Sewage—whether treated or not—kills rivers by overloading them with nutrients,\" he says. \"The result is ecological collapse: fewer fish, fewer insects, fewer plants. And now, we’re seeing the human health risks too.\"  Recent studies have detected dangerous levels of faecal bacteria in freshwater, raising concerns about illnesses\n",
      "Оценка статьи: - **Tone Shift**: The original maintains a measured journalistic tone with observational details (e.g., \"sharp wind blows droplets upstream\"), while the generated version adopts a more sensationalist tone (\"deceptively beautiful,\" \"lifeless, gray sludge\") with heightened emotional framing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Narrative Structure**: The original weaves historical context and multiple firsthand accounts organically, whereas the generated version segments the story into dramatic subheadings (\"A Sacred Source Betrayed,\" \"The Sewage Scandal Uncovered\"), creating a more segmented, magazine-style narrative.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lexical Variety**: The original uses varied, naturalistic descriptions (e.g., \"burbling limestone waters,\" \"pastoral beauty of Pangbourne\"), while the generated version relies on repetitive, emotionally charged phrases (\"raw sewage,\" \"toxic cocktail,\" \"ecological disaster\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Quote Realism**: Original quotes feel authentic and conversational (e.g., Wallace’s recollection of swimming), while generated quotes are more polished and rhetorically heightened (\"Ancient civilizations would have worshipped these springs. We? We poison them\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Detail Specificity**: The original includes nuanced, place-based details (e.g., \"Fairford, 4 miles from the source,\" \"13th-century bridge at Newbridge\"), while the generated version favors generalized statistics and bullet-pointed data (\"12,105 hours of raw sewage,\" \"3.5 billion liters of untreated waste\").\n",
      "итоговая статья: **The Thames Under Threat: A River's Struggle Against Pollution**  On a brisk May morning, environmental activist Dave Wallace wades into the Thames near Fawley Meadows, the sharp wind rippling the water’s surface as he fills a sampling beaker. The scene appears idyllic—red kites circling above, the historic Henley Bridge framing the view—but Wallace knows the river’s condition tells a different story.  \"It was during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim that I realized something was wrong,\" Wallace recalls. \"The water wasn’t just clear—it had an unnatural clarity, with visible streaks of sediment. That’s when it hit me: I was swimming in sewage.\"  His experience is far from unique. Along the Thames’ 215-mile course, from its source in the Cotswolds to its estuary at the North Sea, concerns over pollution have galvanized a growing coalition of anglers, scientists, and local residents. What began as isolated complaints has evolved into a coordinated effort to document discharges and pressure authorities for action.  ### **Trouble at the Source**  The Thames begins at Trewsbury Mead near Kemble, where groundwater bubbles up through limestone, forming the river’s first clear pools. \"This is where the river is born pure,\" says Chris Park, a local meadmaker and longtime resident. \"But by the time it reaches Fairford, just four miles downstream, you start seeing the impact.\"  Fairford’s aging sewage treatment plant discharged untreated waste into the River Coln, a Thames tributary, for 44 consecutive days in early 2024. \"Raw sewage was flowing into what should be a protected waterway,\" says Andrew Doherty, a Fairford councilor. \"We’re still relying on infrastructure that belongs in the 19th century.\"  ### **A Pattern of Neglect**  Near Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith surveys the confluence of the Thames and Windrush rivers. \"I used to fish here as a boy,\" he says. \"The gravel beds were alive. Now, the water’s murky, and the fish are disappearing.\"  Smith’s investigative instincts led him to collaborate with data analyst Professor Peter Hammond. Their 2023 report to Parliament revealed that sewage discharges were occurring far more frequently than official estimates suggested. Key findings included:  - Over **12,000 hours** of raw sewage released into the Thames in London during 2023-2024.  - **3.5 billion liters** of untreated waste discharged at Mogden treatment plant in 2020—equivalent to 1,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  - More than **2,000 treatment plants** nationwide now under investigation for potential violations.  ### **The Hidden Dangers**  While raw sewage captures headlines, James Wallace of River Action warns that even treated wastewater poses risks. \"Modern treatment removes solids but leaves behind phosphates and nitrates,\" he explains. \"These nutrients fuel algal blooms that choke ecosystems.\"  Recent studies have detected elevated levels of fecal bacteria in freshwater, raising public health concerns. \"We’re seeing more cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and antibiotic-resistant infections,\" says Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine. \"The warning not to swallow river water isn’t just precautionary—it’s based on evidence.\"  Thames Water acknowledges the challenges, citing \"unprecedented rainfall\" and \"antiquated infrastructure\" as contributing factors. Spokesperson Emma Reynolds states, \"We’re investing £1.6 billion in upgrades, but systemic change takes time.\"  For activists like Dave Wallace, that timeline is too slow. \"Every delay means more damage,\" he says, examining his latest water sample. \"The Thames survived the Great Stink of 1858. The question is whether it can survive this.\"\n"

      "Статья после изменений: **Conservative MPs Face Historic Challenge as Polls Predict Major Losses**  Senior Conservative figures are bracing for significant electoral setbacks as new polling indicates the party could lose dozens of traditionally safe seats in the upcoming general election. Sophisticated MRP models, developed by leading election analysts, suggest boundary changes, voter dissatisfaction, and a surge in support for opposition parties may erode long-standing Tory majorities.  In Bristol Central, Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire—previously considered secure with a 28,000-vote majority—now faces a strong challenge from the Greens, who have mobilized support among younger voters and renters. Meanwhile, in Altrincham and Sale West, veteran Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, first elected in 1997, is confronting an unusually competitive race as Labour gains ground.  The boundary review has further complicated Conservative prospects, redrawing constituencies in ways that disrupt historical voting patterns. Party strategists privately acknowledge the scale of the challenge, with one noting that even previously reliable seats are now in play due to public frustration over issues ranging from NHS waiting times to economic instability.  Labour, though benefiting from the anti-Tory sentiment, is not without its own challenges. Former leader Ed Miliband is facing a tighter contest in Doncaster North than initially anticipated, while other Labour candidates remain cautious against overconfidence.  Some Conservatives point to recent policy announcements, such as Rishi Sunak’s National Service proposal, as potential rallying points. Yet retirements among long-serving MPs—including Claire Perry O’Neill in Devizes, who cited personal reasons for stepping down—underscore the shifting political landscape.  Political analysts suggest that if current projections hold, the next Parliament could see a dramatic reduction in Conservative representation, marking one of the most significant electoral realignments in recent history. As voters navigate newly drawn constituencies, the outcome may hinge on whether the Tories can regain momentum—or whether opposition parties capitalize on the prevailing discontent.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The tranquil beauty of Fawley Meadows along the River Thames belies a growing crisis beneath its surface. On a breezy late spring day, Dave Wallace, a former open-water swimmer turned environmental activist, wades into the river’s murky waters with a sampling beaker in hand. The scene is picturesque—red kites circling overhead, the historic Henley Bridge framing the horizon—but Wallace knows better than to be fooled by appearances. His once-beloved swimming spot has become a battleground against pollution, a fight he never expected to join until a disturbing encounter two summers ago.  Wallace recalls the moment his perspective shifted. During the Henley to Marlow marathon swim, the river’s sluggish flow and unnerving clarity revealed an unsettling truth. \"The water was stagnant, and I could see brown streaks swirling around me,\" he says. \"It hit me—I was swimming in sewage. That was the day I stopped seeing the Thames as just a place for recreation and started seeing it as a victim.\" His shock turned to action. Now, armed with water quality data and a network of fellow activists, Wallace monitors sewage outflows, documents pollution events, and pressures authorities to address the crisis.  His story is far from unique. Along the Thames’ winding 215-mile journey from its source in the Cotswolds to the North Sea, a grassroots movement has emerged. Fishermen, scientists, retirees, and even former law enforcement officers have become unlikely guardians of the river, united by a shared alarm over its deteriorating health. Their efforts highlight a national scandal: decades of underinvestment, regulatory failures, and corporate negligence have turned England’s rivers into dumping grounds.   A River’s Decline: From Source to Sea  The Thames begins as a trickle at Trewsbury Mead, near Kemble, where limestone aquifers feed its nascent flow. Here, the water is still pure—a fact that makes its subsequent contamination all the more tragic. Chris Park, a local druid and meadmaker, describes the river’s origins with reverence. \"This water is like a newborn—untouched, life-giving,\" he says. \"Ancient cultures worshipped rivers because they understood their sacred role. We’ve forgotten that.\"  But just four miles downstream, in Fairford, the River Coln—one of the Thames’ key tributaries—bears the scars of neglect. Thames Water’s sewage treatment works here has become notorious for discharging untreated waste into the river, even long after heavy rainfall subsides. In early 2024, raw sewage flowed into the Coln for 44 consecutive days, a consequence of crumbling infrastructure overwhelmed by groundwater infiltration.  Andrew Doherty, a local councillor, shakes his head in disbelief. \"This is where the Thames begins, and yet we’re poisoning it before it even has a chance to grow,\" he says. \"We’re in the 21st century, and we’re still treating our rivers like open sewers.\"   The Alarming Reality of Sewage Dumping  Further downstream, near the medieval Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith stands by the confluence of the Thames and the Windrush. The latter, once a crystalline chalk stream teeming with aquatic plants and fish, now runs murky and lifeless. \"I fished here as a boy,\" Smith recalls. \"The gravel beds were clean, the water clear. Now, it’s just a grey sludge.\"  Smith’s frustration led him to investigate. Teaming up with Peter Hammond, a retired professor specializing in data analysis, he uncovered systematic illegal sewage dumping by Thames Water and other privatized utilities. Their research, presented to Parliament, revealed that the scale of unauthorized discharges was ten times higher than the Environment Agency’s estimates—a revelation that sparked a criminal investigation into over 2,000 treatment plants nationwide.  The numbers are staggering. In London alone, Thames Water discharged raw sewage into the Thames for 12,105 hours between 2023 and 2024—a fourfold increase from the previous year. At the Mogden treatment plant near Twickenham, 3.5 billion litres of untreated waste entered the river in 2020, equivalent to 1,400 Olympic swimming pools.   The Hidden Dangers: Beyond Raw Sewage  While raw sewage spills dominate headlines, treated effluent poses an equally insidious threat. Modern wastewater treatment removes solid waste but fails to eliminate harmful nutrients like phosphates and nitrates. These compounds fuel algal blooms, which deplete oxygen, choke aquatic life, and create dead zones.  James Wallace, CEO of River Action, explains the broader implications. \"Sewage—whether treated or not—kills rivers by overloading them with nutrients,\" he says. \"The result is ecological collapse: fewer fish, fewer insects, fewer plants. And now, we’re seeing the human health risks too.\"  Recent studies have detected dangerous levels of faecal bacteria in freshwater, raising concerns about illnesses\n",
      "Оценка статьи: - **Tone Shift**: The original maintains a measured journalistic tone with observational details (e.g., \"sharp wind blows droplets upstream\"), while the generated version adopts a more sensationalist tone (\"deceptively beautiful,\" \"lifeless, gray sludge\") with heightened emotional framing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Narrative Structure**: The original weaves historical context and multiple firsthand accounts organically, whereas the generated version segments the story into dramatic subheadings (\"A Sacred Source Betrayed,\" \"The Sewage Scandal Uncovered\"), creating a more segmented, magazine-style narrative.  \n",

      "- **Lexical Variety**: The original uses varied, naturalistic descriptions (e.g., \"burbling limestone waters,\" \"pastoral beauty of Pangbourne\"), while the generated version relies on repetitive, emotionally charged phrases (\"raw sewage,\" \"toxic cocktail,\" \"ecological disaster\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Quote Realism**: Original quotes feel authentic and conversational (e.g., Wallace’s recollection of swimming), while generated quotes are more polished and rhetorically heightened (\"Ancient civilizations would have worshipped these springs. We? We poison them\").  \n",

      "- **Detail Specificity**: The original includes nuanced, place-based details (e.g., \"Fairford, 4 miles from the source,\" \"13th-century bridge at Newbridge\"), while the generated version favors generalized statistics and bullet-pointed data (\"12,105 hours of raw sewage,\" \"3.5 billion liters of untreated waste\").\n",
      "итоговая статья: **The Thames Under Threat: A River's Struggle Against Pollution**  On a brisk May morning, environmental activist Dave Wallace wades into the Thames near Fawley Meadows, the sharp wind rippling the water’s surface as he fills a sampling beaker. The scene appears idyllic—red kites circling above, the historic Henley Bridge framing the view—but Wallace knows the river’s condition tells a different story.  \"It was during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim that I realized something was wrong,\" Wallace recalls. \"The water wasn’t just clear—it had an unnatural clarity, with visible streaks of sediment. That’s when it hit me: I was swimming in sewage.\"  His experience is far from unique. Along the Thames’ 215-mile course, from its source in the Cotswolds to its estuary at the North Sea, concerns over pollution have galvanized a growing coalition of anglers, scientists, and local residents. What began as isolated complaints has evolved into a coordinated effort to document discharges and pressure authorities for action.  ### **Trouble at the Source**  The Thames begins at Trewsbury Mead near Kemble, where groundwater bubbles up through limestone, forming the river’s first clear pools. \"This is where the river is born pure,\" says Chris Park, a local meadmaker and longtime resident. \"But by the time it reaches Fairford, just four miles downstream, you start seeing the impact.\"  Fairford’s aging sewage treatment plant discharged untreated waste into the River Coln, a Thames tributary, for 44 consecutive days in early 2024. \"Raw sewage was flowing into what should be a protected waterway,\" says Andrew Doherty, a Fairford councilor. \"We’re still relying on infrastructure that belongs in the 19th century.\"  ### **A Pattern of Neglect**  Near Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith surveys the confluence of the Thames and Windrush rivers. \"I used to fish here as a boy,\" he says. \"The gravel beds were alive. Now, the water’s murky, and the fish are disappearing.\"  Smith’s investigative instincts led him to collaborate with data analyst Professor Peter Hammond. Their 2023 report to Parliament revealed that sewage discharges were occurring far more frequently than official estimates suggested. Key findings included:  - Over **12,000 hours** of raw sewage released into the Thames in London during 2023-2024.  - **3.5 billion liters** of untreated waste discharged at Mogden treatment plant in 2020—equivalent to 1,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  - More than **2,000 treatment plants** nationwide now under investigation for potential violations.  ### **The Hidden Dangers**  While raw sewage captures headlines, James Wallace of River Action warns that even treated wastewater poses risks. \"Modern treatment removes solids but leaves behind phosphates and nitrates,\" he explains. \"These nutrients fuel algal blooms that choke ecosystems.\"  Recent studies have detected elevated levels of fecal bacteria in freshwater, raising public health concerns. \"We’re seeing more cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and antibiotic-resistant infections,\" says Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine. \"The warning not to swallow river water isn’t just precautionary—it’s based on evidence.\"  Thames Water acknowledges the challenges, citing \"unprecedented rainfall\" and \"antiquated infrastructure\" as contributing factors. Spokesperson Emma Reynolds states, \"We’re investing £1.6 billion in upgrades, but systemic change takes time.\"  For activists like Dave Wallace, that timeline is too slow. \"Every delay means more damage,\" he says, examining his latest water sample. \"The Thames survived the Great Stink of 1858. The question is whether it can survive this.\"\n"

      "Статья до обработки: Labour is considering significant reforms to capital gains and inheritance taxes as part of its fiscal planning ahead of the next general election, according to policy documents reviewed by the Guardian.  The proposals, still under internal discussion, focus on two key areas: raising capital gains tax (CGT) rates and scaling back inheritance tax reliefs for agricultural and business assets. Treasury estimates suggest the changes could generate up to £10 billion annually.  Under the plans, CGT rates for higher earners could rise substantially, with the top rate potentially increasing from 20% to between 30% and 35%. Basic-rate taxpayers would see a smaller adjustment, with rates possibly climbing from 10% to 15-18%.  The inheritance tax reforms target Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief, which currently offer exemptions of up to 100%. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has floated capping these reliefs at £500,000 per individual, or £1 million where both apply—a move the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.  Economist Dr. Arun Advani of Warwick University, whose research has informed Labour’s thinking, noted that agricultural tax reliefs cost the Treasury approximately £700 million annually. \"These reliefs disproportionately benefit wealthier landowners,\" he said.  Conservative critics argue the changes could have unintended consequences. Former Treasury minister David Gauke warned that forcing asset sales to cover tax bills might lead to land consolidation by institutional investors rather than family successors.  Labour officials stress that no final decisions have been made. \"These are policy options under review, not manifesto commitments,\" said a senior party source. The Office for Budget Responsibility is conducting preliminary analysis of the potential economic effects.  The proposals come as Labour seeks to balance fiscal responsibility with electoral considerations, avoiding income tax hikes while exploring alternative revenue streams. With both major parties preparing their economic platforms, tax policy is expected to feature prominently in the coming election campaign. \n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. **Overuse of Passive Voice & Generic Attribution**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** Phrases like *\"according to policy documents reviewed by the Guardian\"* and *\"Labour officials stress that no final decisions have been made\"* rely on vague sourcing and passive constructions, which are common in LLM outputs but weaken journalistic authority.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Use direct attribution where possible (e.g., *\"A senior Labour source told the Guardian...\"*) and vary sentence structure to avoid monotony.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Formulaic Quote Integration**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The quote from Dr. Arun Advani (*\"These reliefs disproportionately benefit wealthier landowners,\" he said.*) follows a predictable \"expert said\" structure without contextualizing his expertise or integrating the quote more fluidly.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Blend quotes more naturally (e.g., *Dr. Advani, whose research highlights the £700 million annual cost of agricultural reliefs, argued the system favors \"wealthier landowners.\"*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Flat, Overly Balanced Tone**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The text leans into a neutral, \"both sides\" rhythm (*\"Conservative critics argue... Labour officials stress...\"*) without editorial prioritization or narrative momentum, a hallmark of LLM neutrality.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Sharpen the angle—e.g., lead with the most contentious element (like the £10 billion revenue estimate) or highlight political stakes earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Redundant Explanations**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The phrase *\"still under internal discussion\"* is unnecessary after *\"proposals... focus on two key areas,\"* since the latter already implies they’re not finalized. LLMs often over-clarify.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Tighten by merging ideas (e.g., *\"The draft proposals, obtained by the Guardian, target two key areas...\"*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Generic Closing Paragraph**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The final paragraph (*\"The proposals come as Labour seeks to balance...\"*) reads like a boilerplate summary rather than a punchy conclusion, typical of LLM \"wrap-up\" tendencies.  \n",

      "Итог обработки: Labour's shadow Treasury team is weighing aggressive reforms to Britain's capital gains and inheritance tax regimes, with internal documents seen by the Guardian revealing plans that could shake up wealth taxation and generate billions in revenue. At the heart of the draft proposals lie two politically sensitive targets: hiking capital gains rates for top earners and slashing lucrative inheritance tax breaks for farmland and business assets.A senior Labour source confirmed the party is modeling scenarios where the top capital gains rate jumps from 20% to as high as 35% for higher-rate taxpayers, while basic-rate payers could see their rate nearly double. The more explosive element involves gutting Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief—currently allowing total inheritance tax exemptions—with potential caps of £500,000 per individual. Treasury forecasts seen by the Guardian suggest the combined measures could yield £10 billion annually, though insiders caution the numbers remain speculative.Warwick University economist Dr. Arun Advani, whose research exposed how agricultural reliefs drain £700 million yearly from Treasury coffers, told the Guardian the current system operates as \"a stealth subsidy for the landed gentry.\" His 2022 study found the top 1% of agricultural landowners capture over half the tax relief benefits. \"When a dairy farmer's heir pays less inheritance tax than a Londoner inheriting a modest flat, something's broken,\" Advani said.The proposals have drawn fire from rural Conservative MPs and former Treasury minister David Gauke, who warned the changes could trigger \"a firesale of family farms to private equity.\" But Labour's frontbench appears emboldened by polling showing public support for closing wealth tax loopholes. \"We're not touching income tax, but asking those with assets to pay their fair share isn't unreasonable,\" argued one shadow minister, speaking on condition of anonymity.With the Office for Budget Responsibility preparing its assessment ahead of the autumn fiscal statement, Labour's tax architects face delicate calculations. Party strategists must weigh the appeal of revenue-raising measures against potential backlash in key marginal seats with significant farmland holdings. The coming months will test whether Starmer's team can turn these technical tax proposals into a compelling narrative about economic fairness—without handing the Conservatives ammunition to paint them as anti-business.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: **The Thames Under Threat: A River's Struggle Against Pollution**  On a brisk May morning, environmental activist Dave Wallace wades into the Thames near Fawley Meadows, the sharp wind rippling the water’s surface as he fills a sampling beaker. The scene appears idyllic—red kites circling above, the historic Henley Bridge framing the view—but Wallace knows the river’s condition tells a different story.  \"It was during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim that I realized something was wrong,\" Wallace recalls. \"The water wasn’t just clear—it had an unnatural clarity, with visible streaks of sediment. That’s when it hit me: I was swimming in sewage.\"  His experience is far from unique. Along the Thames’ 215-mile course, from its source in the Cotswolds to its estuary at the North Sea, concerns over pollution have galvanized a growing coalition of anglers, scientists, and local residents. What began as isolated complaints has evolved into a coordinated effort to document discharges and pressure authorities for action.  ### **Trouble at the Source**  The Thames begins at Trewsbury Mead near Kemble, where groundwater bubbles up through limestone, forming the river’s first clear pools. \"This is where the river is born pure,\" says Chris Park, a local meadmaker and longtime resident. \"But by the time it reaches Fairford, just four miles downstream, you start seeing the impact.\"  Fairford’s aging sewage treatment plant discharged untreated waste into the River Coln, a Thames tributary, for 44 consecutive days in early 2024. \"Raw sewage was flowing into what should be a protected waterway,\" says Andrew Doherty, a Fairford councilor. \"We’re still relying on infrastructure that belongs in the 19th century.\"  ### **A Pattern of Neglect**  Near Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith surveys the confluence of the Thames and Windrush rivers. \"I used to fish here as a boy,\" he says. \"The gravel beds were alive. Now, the water’s murky, and the fish are disappearing.\"  Smith’s investigative instincts led him to collaborate with data analyst Professor Peter Hammond. Their 2023 report to Parliament revealed that sewage discharges were occurring far more frequently than official estimates suggested. Key findings included:  - Over **12,000 hours** of raw sewage released into the Thames in London during 2023-2024.  - **3.5 billion liters** of untreated waste discharged at Mogden treatment plant in 2020—equivalent to 1,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  - More than **2,000 treatment plants** nationwide now under investigation for potential violations.  ### **The Hidden Dangers**  While raw sewage captures headlines, James Wallace of River Action warns that even treated wastewater poses risks. \"Modern treatment removes solids but leaves behind phosphates and nitrates,\" he explains. \"These nutrients fuel algal blooms that choke ecosystems.\"  Recent studies have detected elevated levels of fecal bacteria in freshwater, raising public health concerns. \"We’re seeing more cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and antibiotic-resistant infections,\" says Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine. \"The warning not to swallow river water isn’t just precautionary—it’s based on evidence.\"  Thames Water acknowledges the challenges, citing \"unprecedented rainfall\" and \"antiquated infrastructure\" as contributing factors. Spokesperson Emma Reynolds states, \"We’re investing £1.6 billion in upgrades, but systemic change takes time.\"  For activists like Dave Wallace, that timeline is too slow. \"Every delay means more damage,\" he says, examining his latest water sample. \"The Thames survived the Great Stink of 1858. The question is whether it can survive this.\"\n",
      "Оценка статьи: Here are the top 5 issues that make this article resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Overly Structured Narrative Flow**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The article follows a rigid, predictable structure—introduction, problem breakdown (\"Trouble at the Source\"), supporting data (\"A Pattern of Neglect\"), and expert commentary (\"The Hidden Dangers\"). While logical, this lacks the organic flow of human journalism, which often weaves facts and quotes more dynamically.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Vary the pacing—mix data with personal anecdotes, or introduce key findings mid-narrative rather than in bullet points.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Excessive Use of Block Quotes**  \n",
      "**Issue:** Quotes are introduced in a repetitive format: *\"Quote,\" says [Name], [Title].* This mechanical attribution style is common in LLM writing but feels robotic compared to human journalism, where quotes are often integrated more fluidly.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Vary attribution placement (e.g., \"According to [Name], [Title], 'Quote.'\") or embed quotes within analysis (e.g., \"The water's unnatural clarity—'streaks of sediment,' as Wallace describes it—alarmed swimmers.\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Over-Explained Transitions**  \n",
      "**Issue:** Sections are introduced with heavy-handed headers (\"Trouble at the Source,\" \"A Pattern of Neglect\") and explicit transitions (\"His experience is far from unique\"). Human journalism often implies connections rather than stating them outright.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Use subtler segues (e.g., \"Downstream from Trewsbury Mead, the river’s purity fades fast\") or let contrasting details (e.g., idyllic scenery vs. pollution stats) create natural tension.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Formulaic Data Presentation**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The bullet-point list of statistics, while clear, feels like an AI-generated \"info dump.\" Human journalists typically integrate key figures into the narrative or use more varied formatting (e.g., callout boxes, inline emphasis).  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Weave stats into quotes (e.g., \"Hammond’s research exposed **12,000 hours** of sewage spills—'enough to fill Wembley Stadium twice,' he says\") or use comparative analogies (\"The Mogden discharges could drown Central Park in 10 feet of waste\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Overly Balanced Tone**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The article gives equal weight to activist outrage,\n",
      "итоговая статья: The Thames looks deceptively serene where Dave Wallace wades in near Fawley Meadows, the morning sun glinting off water that has drawn poets and painters for centuries. But the environmental activist isn’t here for the scenery. As he fills a sampling beaker, the wind carries not the crisp scent of river air but something fainter, more chemical. \"You wouldn’t know it to look at it,\" he says, swirling the cloudy liquid, \"but this stretch is a dumping ground.\"  Wallace first grew suspicious during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim, when competitors emerged with rashes and stomach cramps. \"The water had this eerie clarity—not clean, but sterile, like something had killed off the life in it,\" he recalls. Testing later confirmed his fears: E. coli levels exceeded safe limits by 35 times.  From the Cotswolds to the North Sea, the Thames’ 215-mile journey tells two stories. At Trewsbury Mead, where limestone-filtered springs form the river’s source, local meadmaker Chris Park describes water so pure \"you could bottle it as mineral water.\" But just downstream in Fairford, an overburdened Victorian-era treatment plant spewed raw sewage into the Coln tributary for 44 straight days last winter. Councilor Andrew Doherty keeps photos on his phone of the aftermath—toilet paper snagged in riverside bushes, brown foam collecting in eddies. \"When it rains, our sewage system becomes a time machine,\" he says dryly.  The crisis extends beyond overflows. Retired detective Ash Smith, who spent childhood summers fishing near Newbridge, now documents ecological decline with the precision of a cold case. \"The gravel beds where trout spawned are blanketed in algae,\" he says, pulling up a 2023 satellite image showing sewage plumes fanning into the Thames from 17 different discharge points. His collaboration with data analyst Peter Hammond revealed a staggering gap between official reports and reality: Thames Water’s own monitors logged over 12,000 hours of illegal discharges in London alone last year—enough, Hammond calculates, \"to fill Wembley Stadium twice with raw waste.\"  While headlines focus on visible pollution, scientists warn of invisible threats. \"Treatment plants remove the solids but not the chemical cocktail,\" explains James Wallace of River Action (no relation to Dave). He cites the Thames’ phosphate levels, which have tripled since 1990, fueling algal blooms that suffocate fish. Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine has traced antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains from river water to hospital patients. \"We’ve found bacteria resistant to last-resort drugs like colistin,\" she says. \"These waterways are becoming petri dishes.\"  Thames Water blames climate change and aging infrastructure, pledging £1.6 billion in upgrades. But critics note the company paid shareholders £37 million last year while pleading poverty to regulators. As Dave Wallace packs his water samples—destined for a citizen science database used in lawsuits—he gestures toward a swan gliding past. \"Queen Elizabeth called the Thames ‘liquid history,’\" he says. \"Right now, we’re writing a very ugly chapter.\"\n"

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: A Reform UK activist in the constituency where Nigel Farage is standing has been secretly filmed making extremely racist comments about Rishi Sunak, as well as using Islamophobic and other offensive language.\n",
      "Farage said he was “dismayed” by the views expressed by Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, who was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News.\n",
      "The channel also secretly filmed George Jones, a longtime party activist who organises events for Farage, making homophobic comments, calling the Pride flag “degenerate” and LGBT people “nonces”.\n",
      "The emergence of the footage, filming of which concluded last week, comes on the same day that Reform dropped an election candidate in another seat, after the Guardian informed the party that Raymond Saint had been on a list of members of the British National party.\n",
      "The most serious comments uncovered by Channel 4 News involved Parker, who was covertly filmed making them while canvassing and travelling by car around Clacton, where Farage is the favourite to unseat the incumbent Conservative.\n",
      "During one journey, Parker described Sunak as “fucking [P-word]”. He said: “I’ve always been a Tory voter, but what annoys me is that fucking [P-word] we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. Fucking useless.”\n",
      "Telling the reporter, who was posing as an activist, to “emphasise ‘illegal’” if discussing migration with minority ethnic voters, Parker called Islam “a cult”, saying: “We’re fucking kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoon’s.”\n",
      "In one doorstep conversation with a voter, Parker suggests shooting asylum seekers who try to come to England on small boats. “You’ve got Deal, haven’t you,” he says, referring to the town in Kent. “The place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them.”\n",
      "In another covertly filmed exchange, at a pub in Clacton, Jones reacts with scorn when he sees a police car going past displaying a Pride flag. He says: “You see that fucking degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.”\n",
      "Later, explaining what he says would be policies for a future Reform government, Jones says: “Our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police,” and that the party should “bring back the noose”.\n",
      "In a statement to Channel 4 News, Parker said Farage and Reform were not aware of his views, and he was sorry if they “have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute”.\n",
      "“I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform party are aware of my personal views on immigration,” he said. “Any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage.”\n",
      "Farage said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.\n",
      "“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\n",
      "While the party swiftly distanced itself from the rhetoric, it is the latest in a series of controversies in which Reform candidates or other party figures have been shown to have said offensive things or held extreme views.\n",
      "This month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP.\n",
      "The party has not yet appeared to have taken any action against its candidate in Southend East and Rochford who was reported as having said arriving asylum seekers should be “slaughtered”.\n",
      "Leslie Lilley made the comments in a Facebook post in 2020, the Times reported, also referring to “more scum entering the UK”. \n",

      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: The recent undercover investigation by Channel 4 News has exposed deeply troubling racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic remarks made by activists associated with Reform UK, casting a shadow over Nigel Farage’s campaign in Clacton. The revelations have sparked outrage and forced the party into damage control, with Farage himself expressing dismay and swiftly cutting ties with those involved. The footage, which concluded filming last week, has raised serious questions about the culture within Reform UK and the vetting processes for its candidates and volunteers.  \n",
      "Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser working in Clacton—where Farage is the frontrunner to unseat the Conservative incumbent—was secretly recorded making vile comments about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, referring to him with a racial slur and dismissing him as \"fucking useless.\" Parker’s rhetoric extended beyond Sunak, as he advocated for aggressive and violent measures against migrants, including suggesting that asylum seekers crossing the Channel should be shot by army recruits stationed on beaches. His remarks about Islam were equally inflammatory, describing the religion as \"a cult\" and proposing that mosques be converted into Wetherspoon’s pubs.  \n",
      "In a separate recording, George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage, was filmed making homophobic comments, deriding the Pride flag as \"degenerate\" and referring to LGBT individuals with offensive language. Jones went further, suggesting that police officers should function as paramilitaries and advocating for the return of capital punishment, stating that the party should \"bring back the noose.\" His remarks, captured in a Clacton pub, reflect a disturbing undercurrent of extremism that has alarmed political observers.  \n",
      "Following the release of the footage, Parker issued a statement claiming that neither Farage nor Reform UK were aware of his personal views, insisting that his comments were his own and did not reflect the party’s stance. Farage, in response, condemned the language used by Parker and Jones, emphasizing that their views were not representative of Reform UK or its supporters. He confirmed that both individuals had been removed from the campaign, describing their sentiments as \"appalling\" and \"reprehensible.\"  \n",
      "However, this is not the first time Reform UK has faced scrutiny over the conduct of its members. Earlier this month, Grant StClair-Armstrong, a candidate for the party, resigned after it was revealed he had previously encouraged voters to support the far-right British National Party (BNP). Another candidate, Leslie Lilley, who is standing in Southend East and Rochford, has faced criticism for past comments in which he allegedly referred to asylum seekers as \"scum\" and suggested they should be \"slaughtered.\" Despite these controversies, Reform UK has yet to take action against Lilley, raising concerns about the party’s commitment to rooting out extremism within its ranks.  \n",
      "Political analysts have pointed out that these incidents highlight a broader issue within Reform UK—namely, the challenge of maintaining a coherent and moderate public image while attracting support from individuals with extreme views. Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a professor of political science at the University of Essex, noted that Farage’s party has long walked a fine line between mainstream populism and fringe extremism. \"Reform UK has positioned itself as a voice for disaffected voters, but these revelations suggest that some within its ranks hold views that go far beyond acceptable political discourse,\" she said. \"The party’s failure to thoroughly vet its candidates and activists risks undermining its credibility.\"  \n",
      "The timing of the scandal is particularly damaging for Reform UK, coming just weeks before the general election. Farage, who has built his political career on anti-establishment rhetoric, now faces the difficult task of distancing himself from the toxic elements within his own movement. Critics argue that the party’s rapid growth and reliance on grassroots activism have made it vulnerable to infiltration by individuals with extremist agendas.  \n",
      "Meanwhile, rival parties have seized on the controversy to attack Reform UK’s legitimacy. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party described the revelations as \"deeply disturbing\" and called for Farage to take stronger action to purge extremist elements from his campaign. Labour’s shadow home secretary, meanwhile, accused Reform UK of fostering a culture of intolerance, warning that such rhetoric could fuel division and hatred in communities.  \n",
      "As the fallout continues, the scandal raises uncomfortable questions about the state of British politics and the rise of populist movements. While Farage has sought to present Reform UK as a credible alternative to the mainstream parties, the latest revelations threaten to overshadow his campaign and reinforce perceptions that his party is a magnet for far-right sympathizers. Whether Reform UK can recover from this crisis—and whether voters will be willing to overlook its associations with extremism—remains to be seen.  \n",
      "For now, the spotlight remains firmly on Farage and his ability to control the narrative. With the election fast approaching, the pressure is mounting for Reform UK to demonstrate that it can uphold basic standards of decency and reject the kind of bigotry that has now been exposed at the heart of \n",

The footage... The remarks...\").  4) Introduce more emotional or humanizing framing, such as reactions from affected communities or local residents.  5) Use less formal phrasing in parts of the article to match journalistic tone (e.g., \"sparked outrage\" could be more vivid).  6) Break long paragraphs into shorter, more digestible segments for readability.  7) Include counterpoints or opposing perspectives, such as statements from Reform UK supporters defending the party.  8) Strengthen transitions between paragraphs to improve narrative flow.  9) Avoid overusing passive voice (e.g., \"has been exposed\" → \"undercover footage reveals\").  10) Add a more engaging, narrative-driven opening rather than a summary-style lead.\n",
      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: The dimly lit backroom of The Bell Inn, a weathered Clacton-on-Sea pub popular with locals and campaigners alike, was the setting for some of the most shocking political revelations of this election season. There, undercover footage captured Reform UK activists—some working directly on Nigel Farage’s campaign—voicing racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic views so extreme they’ve sent the party scrambling to contain the fallout.\n",
      "“You see that fucking Paki?” Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, was recorded saying of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in footage obtained by *Channel 4 News*. “He’s fucking useless. We should just throw him in the fucking Channel.” Parker, a burly man in his 50s who had been knocking on doors for Farage in the Essex seaside town, didn’t stop there. He went on to advocate for migrants crossing the Channel to be gunned down by army recruits. “Just shoot the lot,” he said, laughing. “Problem solved.”\n",
      "The footage, filmed over several weeks and aired this week, has ignited a firestorm. Parker’s remarks—which included calling Islam “a cult” and proposing mosques be turned into Wetherspoon’s pubs—were matched by equally incendiary comments from George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage. In another Clacton pub, The Anchor, Jones dismissed the Pride flag as “degenerate” and suggested police should operate as paramilitaries. “Bring back the noose,” he said, leaning across a sticky wooden table. “That’s what this country needs.”\n",
      "Farage, who is leading Reform UK’s charge to unseat the Tory incumbent in Clacton, moved quickly to disown the men. “Their views are appalling and reprehensible,” he said in a hastily arranged press conference outside a seafront campaign office. “They do not represent Reform UK or our supporters.” Both Parker and Jones were immediately cut loose from the campaign, though Parker later insisted in a statement that the party had no prior knowledge of his “personal opinions.”\n",
      "But critics argue the problem runs deeper than two rogue activists. Just weeks earlier, Reform candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after his past endorsement of the far-right BNP came to light. Another candidate, Leslie Lilley, remains on the ballot in Southend despite allegations he once called asylum seekers “scum” who should be “slaughtered.”\n",
      "“This isn’t a one-off—it’s a pattern,” said Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a political scientist at the University of Essex. “Reform UK has always walked a tightrope between populism and extremism, but these revelations show just how thin that line is.”\n",
      "In Clacton, a town that has become a bellwether for Farage’s populist appeal, the scandal has left some voters uneasy. “It’s disgusting,” said Marie Carter, 62, a lifelong resident nursing a pint at The Bell Inn. “I don’t care what party you support—that kind of talk has no place here.” Others, however, shrugged it off. “They’re just saying what a lot of people think,” muttered one man at the bar, who declined to give his name.\n",
      "Rival parties have seized on the controversy. A Conservative spokesperson called the footage “deeply disturbing,” while Labour’s shadow home secretary accused Reform of fostering a “culture of hate.” Even some of Farage’s usual allies have distanced themselves. “This is exactly why people don’t trust politics,” said one exasperated Tory campaigner in Essex.\n",
      "With the election just weeks away, the scandal threatens to derail Farage’s carefully crafted image as a straight-talking outsider. Reform UK’s rapid growth—fueled by grassroots anger over immigration and the cost of living—has left it vulnerable to infiltration by extremists, analysts say.\n",
      "“The question now is whether voters see this as a few bad apples or a fundamental flaw in Reform’s DNA,” said Wilkinson. For Farage, the challenge is clear: prove his party can reject extremism without alienating the anti-establishment base that sustains it.\n",
      "As the sun set over Clacton’s seafront, the mood at Reform’s campaign HQ was tense. Staffers scrolled through social media, bracing for more fallout. One thing was certain: the cameras might have stopped rolling, but the scrutiny was only just beginning. \n",

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 2 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:1. **Overuse of Introductory Phrases in Paragraphs**     - *Pattern*: Multiple paragraphs begin with lead-in phrases like \"The recordings,\" \"Farage responded,\" \"This incident,\" \"Political opponents,\" etc.     - *Issue*: While transitions are necessary, human-written journalism tends to vary sentence structure more fluidly, avoiding repetitive \"This + [subject]\" or \"[Subject] + verb\" openings.     - *Suggestion*: Reconstruct some sentences to start with active verbs, quotes, or contextual details (e.g., *\"‘Bring back the noose,’ said George Jones, a Reform activist, in footage that also captured...\"*).  2. **Neutral Tone in High-Stakes Scenarios**     - *Pattern*: The language remains measured even when describing extreme remarks (e.g., \"expressing extremist views,\" \"inflammatory comments\").     - *Issue*: Human journalists often amplify urgency or moral weight in such cases with sharper phrasing (e.g., \"blatant racism,\" \"shocking calls for violence\") or narrative pacing (e.g., shorter sentences for impact).     - *Suggestion*: Inject more editorial judgment where appropriate (e.g., *\"Parker’s blatant call for murder—‘just shoot the lot’—contradicts Reform’s claims to mainstream legitimacy\"*).  ---  *Bonus note*: The piece is well-structured but could benefit from more vivid details (e.g., specific reactions from Clacton residents, visual descriptions of the footage) to break the \"just-the-facts\" LLM rhythm. \n",

The footage, aired by *Channel 4 News*, reveals activists casually advocating murder, hurling slurs at the prime minister, and mocking LGBTQ+ symbols in conversations they believed were private.  \n",
      "\"Just shoot the lot,\" said Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, when discussing migrants crossing the Channel. His rant escalated into a grotesque parody of military rhetoric: \"Army recruits should use them for target practice.\" Parker, who later claimed his remarks were \"dark humor,\" also called Rishi Sunak a \"fucking useless P***\" who should be \"thrown in the fucking Channel.\" The video shows him sneering at Islam as \"a cult\" while suggesting mosques be turned into budget pubs.  \n",
      "Equally damning was George Jones, a local Reform organizer who arranges events for Farage. \"Bring back the noose,\" Jones declared, slamming his fist on a table when the topic of capital punishment arose. He dismissed Pride flags as \"degenerate\" and lamented the decline of \"traditional British values.\" Both men were swiftly axed from the campaign, though Parker insisted party officials had never vetted his opinions.  \n",
      "Farage’s damage-control press conference did little to quell the outrage. \"Appalling and reprehensible,\" he called the remarks—a scripted condemnation that rang hollow given Reform’s pattern of fielding candidates with extremist ties. Just weeks earlier, Grant StClair-Armstrong quit as a candidate after his past support for the neo-Nazi BNP surfaced. In Southend, Leslie Lilley remains on the ballot despite allegedly calling asylum seekers \"scum\" who deserve slaughter.  \n",
      "Opponents pounced. \"This isn’t just a few bad apples—it’s a culture of hate,\" said Labour’s shadow home secretary. Even Conservative operatives in Essex privately admitted the footage validated public distrust: \"No wonder people think politics is rotten,\" one muttered. The timing couldn’t be worse for Reform, which has surged by exploiting anger over immigration but now faces accusations of harboring far-right elements.  \n",
      "Clacton residents reacted with a mix of revulsion and shrugs. Outside a seafront chip shop, retiree Margaret Higgins said the videos made her \"ashamed to be British,\" while a construction worker countered, \"They’re saying what half this town thinks.\" Such polarized responses underscore Reform’s tightrope walk: galvanizing anti-establishment sentiment without appearing openly extremist.  \n",
      "With the election looming, the scandal has forced Farage into an impossible balancing act. Can he purge toxic elements without alienating the base that revels in his \"tell-it-like-it-is\" branding? The footage suggests some Reform activists aren’t just venting frustrations—they’re fantasizing about violence. As one Tory strategist put it, \"You can’t claim to be mainstream when your volunteers are calling for firing squads.\"  \n",

Classic banter, right?  \n",
      "Meanwhile, George Jones, a local Reform organizer who books Farage’s events, was busy slamming his fist on a table—next to a half-eaten packet of custard creams—and declaring, \"Bring back the noose!\" when capital punishment came up. He dismissed Pride flags as \"degenerate\" and sighed about the death of \"traditional British values,\" whatever those are. Both men got the boot, though Parker whined that nobody in the party had ever bothered to ask his opinions before handing him a clipboard.  \n",

Just weeks earlier, Grant StClair-Armstrong quit as a candidate after someone dug up his old love letters to the neo-Nazi BNP. And in Southend, Leslie Lilley’s still on the ballot despite allegedly calling asylum seekers \"scum\" who deserve to be \"slaughtered.\" But hey, no bad apples here, folks.  \n",

      "The footage captured Andrew Parker, a canvasser for Reform, making inflammatory remarks about migrants crossing the English Channel, suggesting they should be used as \"target practice\" by military recruits. Parker also directed derogatory language toward Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, using an ethnic slur and advocating for him to be \"thrown in the Channel.\" When challenged, Parker later dismissed his comments as \"dark humour,\" though the remarks have drawn widespread condemnation.\n",

      "Nigel Farage swiftly condemned the remarks as \"appalling and reprehensible\" during a press conference, insisting that such views do not represent Reform UK. However, critics argue that the incident is part of a recurring pattern for the party, which has faced multiple controversies involving candidates and activists with extremist associations.\n",
      "Just weeks earlier, Grant StClair-Armstrong, a Reform candidate in another constituency, withdrew from the race after past affiliations with the far-right British National Party (BNP) came to light. Meanwhile, Leslie Lilley, the party’s candidate in Southend, remains on the ballot despite allegations that he referred to asylum seekers as \"scum\" who deserved to be \"slaughtered.\" These incidents have fuelled accusations that Reform has failed to adequately screen its representatives, allowing individuals with extremist views to operate within its ranks.\n",
      "Opposition parties seized on the revelations, with Labour’s shadow home secretary stating that the footage exposed a \"culture of hate\" rather than mere isolated incidents. Conservative figures, speaking privately, expressed concern that such controversies risk further eroding public trust in politics at a time when disillusionment with mainstream parties is already high.\n",
      "In Clacton, reactions among residents were divided. Some, like retiree Margaret Higgins, expressed shame over the comments, while others suggested the sentiments reflected broader frustrations in the area over immigration and cultural change. The mixed responses highlight the challenge Farage faces in balancing his anti-establishment appeal with the need to present Reform as a credible political force.\n",
      "With the general election approaching, the controversy poses a significant reputational risk for Reform UK. Farage has sought to position the party as a legitimate challenger to the Conservatives, capitalising on discontent over immigration and governance. However, the repeated emergence of extremist rhetoric among its activists threatens to undermine that strategy, reinforcing perceptions that the party harbours far-right elements.\n",
      "Political analysts suggest that the incident could alienate moderate voters while emboldening Reform’s core supporters, who may see the dismissals as an overreaction. The broader question is whether the electorate views these remarks as aberrations or indicative of deeper issues within the party’s culture. For a movement striving to enter the political mainstream, the answer could prove decisive in determining its electoral fortunes.\n",
      "As the fallout continues, Reform UK faces mounting pressure to demonstrate that it can enforce stricter vetting procedures and distance itself from individuals espousing extremist views. Failure to do so risks cementing its image as a party unable—or unwilling—to police its own ranks.\n",
      "The timing of the scandal, just weeks before voters go to the polls, ensures that it will remain a focal point in the campaign, with opponents likely to use it as evidence of Reform’s unsuitability for office. For Nigel Farage, the challenge will be to contain the damage without alienating the anti-establishment base that forms the backbone of his support. The coming days will reveal whether the party can recover—or whether this episode becomes a defining moment in its short history.\n"

      "**Undercover Footage Exposes Racist, Extremist Views Among Reform UK Campaigners in Farage’s Clacton Stronghold**  \n",
      "The dimly lit backroom of The Bell Inn, a weathered Clacton-on-Sea pub popular with locals and campaigners alike, was the setting for some of the most shocking political revelations of this election season. There, undercover footage captured Reform UK activists—some working directly on Nigel Farage’s campaign—voicing racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic views so extreme they’ve sent the party scrambling to contain the fallout.  \n",
      "“You see that fucking Paki?” Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, was recorded saying of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in footage obtained by *Channel 4 News*. “He’s fucking useless. We should just throw him in the fucking Channel.” Parker, a burly man in his 50s who had been knocking on doors for Farage in the Essex seaside town, didn’t stop there. He went on to advocate for migrants crossing the Channel to be gunned down by army recruits. “Just shoot the lot,” he said, laughing. “Problem solved.”  \n",
      "The footage, filmed over several weeks and aired this week, has ignited a firestorm. Parker’s remarks—which included calling Islam “a cult” and proposing mosques be turned into Wetherspoon’s pubs—were matched by equally incendiary comments from George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage. In another Clacton pub, The Anchor, Jones dismissed the Pride flag as “degenerate” and suggested police should operate as paramilitaries. “Bring back the noose,” he said, leaning across a sticky wooden table. “That’s what this country needs.”  \n",
      "### **“Appalling and Reprehensible” – Farage’s Damage Control**  \n",
      "Farage, who is leading Reform UK’s charge to unseat the Tory incumbent in Clacton, moved quickly to disown the men. “Their views are appalling and reprehensible,” he said in a hastily arranged press conference outside a seafront campaign office. “They do not represent Reform UK or our supporters.” Both Parker and Jones were immediately cut loose from the campaign, though Parker later insisted in a statement that the party had no prior knowledge of his “personal opinions.”  \n",
      "But critics argue the problem runs deeper than two rogue activists. Just weeks earlier, Reform candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after his past endorsement of the far-right BNP came to light. Another candidate, Leslie Lilley, remains on the ballot in Southend despite allegations he once called asylum seekers “scum” who should be “slaughtered.”  \n",
      "“This isn’t a one-off—it’s a pattern,” said Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a political scientist at the University of Essex. “Reform UK has always walked a tightrope between populism and extremism, but these revelations show just how thin that line is.”  \n",
      "### **Local Backlash and Political Fallout**  \n",
      "In Clacton, a town that has become a bellwether for Farage’s populist appeal, the scandal has left some voters uneasy. “It’s disgusting,” said Marie Carter, 62, a lifelong resident nursing a pint at The Bell Inn. “I don’t care what party you support—that kind of talk has no place here.” Others, however, shrugged it off. “They’re just saying what a lot of people think,” muttered one man at the bar, who declined to give his name.  \n",
      "Rival parties have seized on the controversy. A Conservative spokesperson called the footage “deeply disturbing,” while Labour’s shadow home secretary accused Reform of fostering a “culture of hate.” Even some of Farage’s usual allies have distanced themselves. “This is exactly why people don’t trust politics,” said one exasperated Tory campaigner in Essex.  \n",
      "### **A Test for Farage’s Movement**  \n",
      "With the election just weeks away, the scandal threatens to derail Farage’s carefully crafted image as a straight-talking outsider. Reform UK’s rapid growth—fueled by grassroots anger over immigration and the cost of living—has left it vulnerable to infiltration by extremists, analysts say.  \n",
      "“The question now is whether voters see this as a few bad apples or a fundamental flaw in Reform’s DNA,” said Wilkinson. For Farage, the challenge is clear: prove his party can reject extremism without alienating the anti-establishment base that sustains it.  \n",
      "As the sun set over Clacton’s seafront, the mood at Reform’s campaign HQ was tense. Staffers scrolled through social media, bracing for more fallout. One thing was certain: the cameras might have stopped rolling, but the scrutiny was only just beginning.\n"

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: Labour could select one of three “credible” candidates to run in Diane Abbott’s seat as it seemed intent on not allowing Abbott to stand for the party despite an investigation into her conduct being completed six months ago.\n",
      "Abbott, Britain’s first black female MP, was suspended from the party in April last year over a letter in the Observer suggesting Jewish people were not subject to racism “all their lives”, meaning she was still an independent when parliament was prorogued for the general election on 4 July.\n",
      "Labour’s national executive committee completed its investigation in December, it has emerged, and Abbott was given a formal warning with an instruction to complete an online antisemitism training course in February.\n",
      "It was reported on Tuesday evening that Labour had restored the whip to Abbott, but it remained unlikely that she would be selected as a candidate in the upcoming election.\n",
      "The Guardian understands that the party could make a renewed push to exclude her from standing again for her Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat after she liked a post on X by Jeremy Corbyn’s wife, Laura Alvarez, about his decision to stand as an independent candidate. Restoring the whip to Abbot would allow her to leave the party “with dignity”, according to party sources.\n",
      "In the past, Labour has blocked a number of leftwing hopefuls from standing as candidates and suspended party members for expressing support for other political parties.\n",
      "Although her fate is officially yet to be decided, three Labour activists with links to Abbott’s constituency – Anntoinette Bramble, the deputy mayor of Hackney council; Sem Moema, the London assembly member for North East; and Mete Coban, a Labour councillor for Stoke Newington – have been widely talked about as possible replacements.\n",
      "Abbott was suspended after she wrote a letter, for which she has apologised, suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people were not subject to racism “all their lives”.\n",
      "Party sources acknowledge the huge amount of support that Abbott has locally and had been hoping to find a civil agreement and not stand for Labour at the next election due to what are termed as health difficulties.\n",
      "But sources close to Abbott have questioned why her future in the party has been linked to her health, and why she cannot make the decision.\n",
      "BBC Newsnight was first to report that the NEC had completed its investigation as long ago as December. In March, Abbott strongly denied reports that had she rejected antisemitism training offered by the party.\n",
      "Labour figures from across different factions of the party are understood to be furious that the case was concluded so long ago but shadow ministers have continued to present it as ongoing, seemingly not knowing. Others have expressed concern that black Labour members will feel there is no space for them in the party if she is ejected.\n",
      "After the Guardian revealed that the Conservatives’ biggest donor, Frank Hester, had told colleagues that looking at Abbott made you “want to hate all black women” and that the MP “should be shot”, Abbott said she hoped to receive some “public support” from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.\n",
      "In the wake of the row, Starmer criticised Hester’s “abhorrent language” but told the BBC that Abbott’s suspension “was for an entirely different issue”.\n",
      "When asked about Abbott’s case last week, Starmer said: “The final decisions on candidates is coming up in a few days’ time, I think 4 June – it may be a little earlier, a little later, I can’t quite remember. But within a relatively short period of time the final list of candidates will be decided, and that will be a matter for the Labour party’s national executive committee.”\n",
      "A spokesperson for the leftwing campaign group Momentum said: “This is outrageous news which confirms that the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain’s first black woman MP out of parliament. For months we have been told by Keir Starmer that the process is independent and it’s nothing to do with him.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: The Labour Party is reportedly considering three potential candidates to replace Diane Abbott in her Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency, signaling a growing likelihood that the veteran MP will not be reselected despite the conclusion of an internal investigation into her conduct six months ago. Abbott, who made history as Britain’s first black female MP, was suspended from the party in April 2023 after writing a letter in *The Observer* that suggested Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people had not experienced racism \"all their lives.\" She later apologized for the remarks, but the controversy has continued to overshadow her political future.  \n",
      "Sources within Labour confirm that the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) concluded its investigation in December, issuing Abbott a formal warning and mandating that she complete an online antisemitism awareness course in February. Despite this resolution, reports suggest that senior Labour figures remain reluctant to endorse her candidacy for the upcoming general election. While the whip was reportedly restored to Abbott on Tuesday evening, insiders indicate this may have been a procedural move to allow her to depart the party \"with dignity\" rather than a genuine path to reselection.  \n",
      "The situation escalated after Abbott liked a social media post by Laura Alvarez, the wife of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is now running as an independent. Labour has previously blocked left-wing candidates and suspended members for endorsing rival political figures, raising concerns that Abbott’s actions may have further diminished her standing within the party.  \n",
      "Among the potential replacements being discussed are Anntoinette Bramble, Hackney Council’s deputy mayor; Sem Moema, a London Assembly member for North East; and Mete Coban, a Stoke Newington councillor—all seen as credible alternatives with strong local ties. Labour strategists are said to be wary of the backlash that could follow if Abbott is deselected, given her deep-rooted support in the constituency. Some have suggested that her health—a factor cited by party sources—could be used as a justification for her departure, though allies of Abbott have questioned why her political future should hinge on personal circumstances rather than democratic processes.  \n",
      "The delay in resolving Abbott’s status has sparked frustration across Labour’s factions. BBC *Newsnight* revealed that the NEC had finalized its decision months ago, yet shadow ministers continued to refer to the case as ongoing. Some within the party fear that Abbott’s potential exclusion could alienate Black members, reinforcing perceptions that Labour is marginalizing voices from minority backgrounds.  \n",
      "The controversy has unfolded against a broader political backdrop. Earlier this year, Abbott called for public support from Labour leader Keir Starmer after *The Guardian* reported that Conservative donor Frank Hester had made racially charged remarks about her, including saying she \"should be shot.\" While Starmer condemned Hester’s comments, he maintained that Abbott’s suspension was unrelated, emphasizing that candidate selections were ultimately a matter for the NEC.  \n",
      "Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, has condemned the handling of Abbott’s case, accusing Starmer’s leadership of attempting to force her out of Parliament. \"For months, we’ve been told the process was independent, but this confirms a deliberate effort to sideline Britain’s first Black woman MP,\" a spokesperson said.  \n",
      "As the deadline for candidate selections approaches, the question of Abbott’s future remains unresolved. With Labour poised for a potential return to government, the party’s treatment of one of its most prominent figures could have lasting implications for its internal cohesion and public image. Observers warn that failing to address the situation transparently risks deepening divisions and undermining trust among both members and voters. \n",

      "Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) finalized its investigation in December, issuing Abbott a formal warning and requiring her to complete a two-hour online antisemitism awareness course provided by the Jewish Labour Movement—a standard disciplinary measure for similar cases. \"The course covers historical and contemporary forms of antisemitism, including unconscious bias,\" a Labour official confirmed. Despite this, senior figures remain hesitant to endorse her candidacy.\n",
      "The whip was restored to Abbott on February 27, but party insiders suggest this was procedural rather than a genuine reinstatement. \"This allows her to leave with dignity, but the writing’s on the wall,\" said one NEC member, speaking anonymously. Another added, \"The leadership wants a clean slate before the election.\"\n",
      "Abbott’s allies in Hackney have rallied behind her, with longtime constituent Margaret Greer describing her as \"a fighter who’s always stood up for us.\" Local activists warn that deselecting Abbott, who has held the seat since 1987, could provoke a backlash. \"She’s an institution here. People won’t forget how she’s been treated,\" said Hackney North Labour member Raj Patel.\n",
      "The situation worsened after Abbott liked a social media post by Laura Alvarez, wife of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is now running as an independent. Labour has a history of blocking left-wing candidates who endorse rivals, and some believe this minor gesture sealed her fate. \"It gave them the excuse they needed,\" said a Momentum spokesperson.\n",
      "Among the names floated as replacements are Anntoinette Bramble, Hackney Council’s deputy mayor; Sem Moema, a London Assembly member; and Mete Coban, a Stoke Newington councillor—all seen as Starmer-aligned alternatives. But critics argue the move smacks of factionalism. \"This isn’t about discipline—it’s about purging the left,\" said former shadow minister John McDonnell.\n",
      "The delay in resolving Abbott’s status has frustrated Labour members. *Newsnight* revealed the NEC had reached its decision months ago, yet shadow ministers continued calling it \"ongoing.\" Some fear the optics of sidelining a trailblazing Black MP, particularly after Abbott called for solidarity when Tory donor Frank Hester allegedly said she \"made you want to hate all Black women\" and \"should be shot.\"\n",
      "Starmer condemned Hester’s remarks but insisted Abbott’s suspension was unrelated. \"Selections are for the NEC, not the leadership,\" he said—a stance that has drawn ire. \"If Labour can’t stand by its own pioneers, what does that say?\" asked Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham.\n",
      "With candidate selections looming, Abbott’s fate remains uncertain. As Labour eyes a return to power, its handling of this saga could define its commitment to diversity—or deepen internal rifts. \"This isn’t just about Diane,\" said one Black Labour organizer. \"It’s about whether people like us still have a place in this party.\" \n",

      "4.2.

Abbott, who became Britain's first Black female MP in 1987, was suspended from the parliamentary party in April 2023 after a controversial letter in *The Observer* in which she suggested Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities had not faced lifelong racism. Though she later retracted the remarks, the disciplinary process has cast doubt on her political future.  \n",
      "Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) concluded its investigation in December, issuing Abbott a formal warning and mandating her attendance at an antisemitism training course run by the Jewish Labour Movement—a standard disciplinary response in such cases. While the whip was restored to Abbott in late February, party sources indicate this may have been an administrative formality rather than a full political rehabilitation. \"The process has been followed, but there's no enthusiasm for her to stand again,\" said one Labour official familiar with the matter.  \n",
      "Local support for Abbott remains strong in Hackney, where she has represented the seat for over three decades. Constituency activists have voiced concerns about the potential backlash if she is deselected. \"Diane has been a tireless advocate for this community,\" said a Hackney Labour member who asked not to be named. \"Any move to replace her won't be taken lightly.\"  \n",
      "The situation grew more complicated when Abbott engaged with a social media post by Laura Alvarez, the wife of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is now running as an independent candidate. While the interaction was minor, it drew attention given Labour's stance against members publicly supporting rival candidates. Some within the party viewed it as problematic, though others dismissed it as insignificant. \"It's being overinterpreted,\" said a source close to Abbott.  \n",
      "Among the names under consideration as potential replacements are Anntoinette Bramble, Hackney Council's deputy mayor; Sem Moema, a London Assembly member; and Mete Coban, a local councillor—all seen as aligned with Keir Starmer's leadership. Critics, however, argue the move reflects broader tensions within Labour. \"This isn't just about discipline—it's about the direction of the party,\" said a former shadow minister.  \n",
      "The prolonged uncertainty over Abbott's status has frustrated some Labour members, particularly after reports emerged that the NEC had reached its decision months ago. Shadow ministers had previously described the investigation as ongoing, leading to accusations of mixed messaging. The issue has also intersected with broader debates about representation, particularly after Abbott called for unity following reports that Conservative donor Frank Hester had made racially charged remarks about her.  \n",
      "Starmer has maintained that candidate selections are a matter for the NEC, not the leadership. But the handling of Abbott's case has raised questions about Labour's approach to diversity and internal dissent. \"This is about more than one MP—it's about whether the party truly values its trailblazers,\" said Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham.  \n",

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 3 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated content, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  ### 1. **Overuse of Neutral, Passive Phrasing**     - **Pattern:** The article frequently uses passive or overly balanced phrasing (e.g., \"Some within the party viewed it as problematic, though others dismissed it as insignificant\").     - **Issue:** Human journalism tends to have stronger editorial judgment—either emphasizing one perspective as dominant or structuring debate more dynamically (e.g., \"While some dismissed the interaction as insignificant, critics within Labour saw it as a breach of discipline\").     - **Suggestion:** Reframe debates with clearer hierarchy of perspectives (e.g., prioritize the view of key stakeholders like party officials over unnamed sources).  ### 2. **Formulaic Quote Integration**     - **Pattern:** Quotes are introduced with repetitive structures (e.g., \"said a Hackney Labour member who asked not to be named,\" \"said a source close to Abbott\").     - **Issue:** Human-written journalism varies attribution phrasing for rhythm and avoids overusing anonymous sourcing unless necessary.     - **Suggestion:** Vary attribution (e.g., \"according to local party activists,\" \"one NEC insider argued\") and reduce reliance on unnamed voices where possible.  ### 3. **Over-Explained Context**     - **Pattern:** The article includes excessive background details (e.g., Abbott’s 1987 milestone, the *Observer* letter recap) in a way that disrupts narrative flow.     - **Issue:** Professional journalism assumes reader familiarity with major ongoing stories (e.g., Abbott’s suspension) and weaves context more succinctly.     - **Suggestion:** Tighten background to one crisp paragraph or integrate it dynamically (e.g., \"Abbott, suspended last April over remarks about racism…\").  ---  **Bonus Note:** The piece lacks a distinct voice or angle—common in LLM output. A human editor might sharpen the framing (e.g., \"Labour’s Dilemma: Discipline vs. Diversity in Abbott Case\"). \n",

      "5.2. [ID 7] Статья после четвертого изменения: The Labour Party faces a delicate balancing act as it considers the political future of Diane Abbott, the trailblazing MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington. After a year-long suspension and disciplinary process following controversial remarks about racism, Abbott’s return to the parliamentary party in February appears increasingly precarious—with senior figures quietly preparing for her potential deselection.  \n",
      "Abbott’s suspension last April stemmed from a letter in *The Observer* where she suggested Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities hadn’t experienced lifelong racism, a claim she later retracted. The National Executive Committee’s disciplinary response—a formal warning and mandatory antisemitism training—was widely seen as procedural rather than conciliatory. Though the whip was restored, multiple Labour insiders describe it as an administrative step, not an endorsement. \"The process box has been ticked, but there’s no appetite for her to run again,\" admitted a senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  \n",
      "In Hackney, where Abbott has served since 1987, local activists remain fiercely loyal. Many view any move to replace her as politically tone-deaf, particularly given her historic status as Britain’s first Black female MP. \"She’s been our voice through three decades of battles—on housing, policing, inequality,\" said a longtime constituency organizer, echoing widespread sentiment. Yet this grassroots support clashes with the leadership’s apparent resolve to turn the page.  \n",
      "Complications arose in March when Abbott engaged with a social media post by Laura Alvarez, wife of Jeremy Corbyn—now running as an independent against Labour. While the interaction was brief, it reignited tensions within the party over discipline and loyalty. NEC members privately cited it as evidence of Abbott’s \"unwillingness to conform,\" though allies dismissed the scrutiny as disproportionate. \"This is about finding excuses to sideline her,\" argued one MP close to Abbott.  \n",
      "The list of potential successors underscores Labour’s shifting priorities. Deputy Hackney Mayor Anntoinette Bramble, London Assembly member Sem Moema, and councillor Mete Coban—all Starmer allies—have been floated as replacements. Critics see the move as emblematic of Labour’s broader ideological tightening. \"They’re purging anyone tied to the Corbyn era, even pioneers like Diane,\" said a former shadow cabinet minister.  \n",
      "The protracted handling of Abbott’s case has fueled frustration. Despite the NEC finalizing its decision last December, shadow ministers continued referring to the investigation as \"ongoing\" well into 2024—a discrepancy that exposed divisions. The situation grew more charged when Abbott called for unity after reports that Tory donor Frank Hester had made racist remarks about her, prompting awkward questions about Labour’s own commitment to protecting diverse voices.  \n",
      "Keir Starmer has publicly deferred to the NEC on candidate selections, but the Abbott dilemma tests his balancing act between party discipline and representation. \"This isn’t just about rules—it’s about whether Labour honors its history while moving forward,\" said Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham. With a general election looming, the stakes extend beyond one constituency. However the party resolves Abbott’s status, the decision will send a signal about who belongs in Labour’s vision for power—and who gets left behind.  \n",
      "As selection processes accelerate, local members and national strategists remain at odds. \"However you frame it, pushing out someone like Diane after 37 years isn’t just personnel change—it’s a statement,\" warned a Labour campaign veteran. That statement, whatever it ultimately says, could haunt the party long after the ballots are counted. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. [ID 8] Статья после пятого изменения: The Labour Party’s got Diane Abbott dangling like a loose thread on a cheap suit—and ain’t nobody got time for neat sewing. The trailblazing MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, who’s been around longer than most of Starmer’s policy positions, is caught in this weird limbo where the party keeps pretending they want her but also keeps eyeing the exit door.  \n",
      "Abbott’s suspension last April—after that *Observer* letter where she kinda-sorta implied Jewish, Irish, and Traveller folks don’t *really* get racism—was messy. She walked it back, sure, but the NEC still made her sit through antisemitism training like a kid in detention. The whip got restored in February, but let’s be real: it’s the political equivalent of your ex texting \"we should talk\" and then ghosting. \"Process box ticked, but no one’s throwing her a welcome-back party,\" muttered some senior official, stirring his tea with a biro that definitely wasn’t his.  \n",
      "Down in Hackney, though? Different story. Abbott’s been their MP since *1987*—back when Starmer was probably still prosecuting parking tickets—and the locals aren’t having it. \"She fought for us when no one else gave a damn,\" said a constituency organizer, fiddling with a cracked iPhone case. The room smelled like stale coffee and unresolved tension. But up in Labour HQ, they’re all about \"moving forward,\" which apparently means sidelining anyone who reminds them of the Corbyn era.  \n",
      "Then March happened. Abbott liked—or maybe just glanced at?—a post by Laura Alvarez, Corbyn’s wife. Cue the drama. NEC types clutched their pearls: \"See? She’s *unwilling to conform*!\" Meanwhile, Abbott’s allies rolled their eyes so hard you could hear it. \"They’re just digging for reasons to boot her,\" sighed one MP, mid-bite into a sad tuna sandwich.  \n",
      "The potential replacements? Oh, it’s a Starmer fanclub lineup: Deputy Mayor Anntoinette Bramble, Assembly member Sem Moema, councillor Mete Coban—all solid, sure, but also *very* convenient. \"This isn’t about talent, it’s about control,\" grumbled a former shadow minister, while his cat—April 1st birthday, ironically—knocked over a water glass.  \n",
      "The whole thing’s dragged on like a bad Netflix series. NEC wrapped up their investigation in December, but shadow ministers kept calling it \"ongoing\" for months. Then Tory donor Frank Hester popped off with racist remarks about Abbott, and suddenly Labour had to awkwardly cough into its fist about \"protecting diverse voices.\" The irony? Thick enough to spread on toast.  \n",
      "Starmer’s playing the \"NEC decides\" card, but everyone knows this is about him. \"It’s not just rules—it’s about whether Labour even *respects* its own history,\" said Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham, while someone’s phone buzzed incessantly with a spam call.  \n",
      "Local members are furious. National strategists are sweating. And Abbott? She’s just there, tapping her pen against a stale donut, waiting for the axe or the apology—whichever comes first. \"Kicking her out after 37 years isn’t just change, it’s a *message*,\" warned some campaign vet, like, duh.  \n",
      "And that message? Probably gonna sting worse than a paper cut when the ballots drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. [ID 9] Статья после шестогоятого изменения: The Labour Party’s prolonged uncertainty over Diane Abbott’s future has exposed tensions between its leadership and its historical roots. The veteran MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, first elected in 1987, remains in political limbo following her suspension last year over controversial remarks in a letter to *The Observer*. While the whip was restored in February, her full reintegration into the party remains unresolved, raising concerns about Labour’s approach to internal discipline and its treatment of long-standing figures.\n",
      "Ms. Abbott’s suspension in April 2023 followed a letter in which she suggested that Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities did not experience racism in the same way as Black people. Though she later retracted the comments and underwent antisemitism training, the episode has left lingering doubts about her position within the party. The restoration of the whip earlier this year was seen as a procedural step rather than a full endorsement, with senior figures privately acknowledging that her return has not been met with enthusiasm.\n",
      "In her Hackney constituency, Ms. Abbott retains strong backing. Local activists and supporters argue that her decades of advocacy for marginalized communities should outweigh recent controversies. \"She has been a tireless campaigner for this area when others ignored it,\" said one constituency organiser. However, at the national level, Labour’s leadership appears keen to distance itself from figures associated with the Jeremy Corbyn era. The party’s emphasis on \"moving forward\" has been interpreted by some as an effort to sideline those whose political stances no longer align with Sir Keir Starmer’s vision.\n",
      "The situation escalated in March when Ms. Abbott engaged with a social media post by Laura Alvarez, Mr. Corbyn’s wife. Some within Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) viewed this as evidence of her unwillingness to conform to the party’s current direction. Supporters, however, dismissed the criticism as a pretext to justify her exclusion. \"They are searching for reasons to push her out,\" remarked one Labour MP.\n",
      "Meanwhile, speculation persists over potential successors in Hackney North and Stoke Newington. Names such as Deputy Mayor Anntoinette Bramble, Assembly member Sem Moema, and councillor Mete Coban have been floated—all seen as aligned with Sir Keir’s leadership. Critics argue that the selection process is less about merit and more about consolidating control.\n",
      "The NEC concluded its investigation into Ms. Abbott’s case in December, yet shadow ministers continued to describe it as \"ongoing\" for months afterward. The timing became particularly awkward when Tory donor Frank Hester made racially charged remarks about Ms. Abbott, forcing Labour into an uncomfortable position of condemning racism while still hesitating to fully embrace one of its own most prominent Black MPs.\n",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has deferred responsibility to the NEC, but observers suggest the ultimate decision reflects his broader strategy to reshape the party. \"This isn’t just about rules—it’s about whether Labour values its own history,\" said Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham.\n",
      "The prolonged uncertainty has frustrated local members and raised questions about Labour’s commitment to diversity and internal democracy. Removing a trailblazing MP after 37 years would send a clear signal about the party’s direction—one that may alienate some of its traditional supporters.\n",
      "As the situation drags on, the broader implications for Labour’s unity and electoral strategy remain uncertain. The handling of Ms. Abbott’s case could influence perceptions of the party’s respect for its past while shaping its future cohesion. With a general election approaching, the resolution—or lack thereof—may carry consequences beyond a single constituency. \n",

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: Angela Rayner has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing over claims she avoided tax on the sale of a home, with the Labour deputy leader criticising what she called the “desperate tactics” of Conservative MPs who urged police to investigate.\n",
      "In a statement, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said any allegations that Rayner should have paid capital gains tax or council tax would not fall under their jurisdiction, and that they had shared details of their investigation with the local council, Stockport, and HMRC. The Guardian understands that neither of these bodies plan to take action.\n",
      "Rayner had said she would resign as deputy leader if she was found to have broken the law by avoiding tax when she sold the former council home she owned for a profit in 2015. The Conservatives had put pressure on police to look into claims that she had wrongly designated the home as her principal residence, and that it was wrongly listed on the electoral register.\n",
      "“Following allegations about Angela Rayner MP, Greater Manchester police has completed a thorough, carefully considered and proportionate investigation,” a spokesperson for the force said. “We have concluded that no further police action will be taken.\n",
      "“The investigation originated from complaints made by Mr James Daly MP directly to GMP. Subsequent further contact with GMP by members of the public, and claims made by individuals featured in media reporting, indicated a strong public interest in the need for allegations to be investigated.\n",
      "“Matters involving council tax and personal tax do not fall into the jurisdiction of policing. GMP has liaised with Stockport council and information about our investigation has been shared with them. Details of our investigation have also been shared with His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.”\n",
      "It is understood that HMRC also looked into the issue, at Rayner’s request, and has confirmed there is no capital gains tax liability, meaning no action will be taken.\n",
      "Stockport council said it had “reviewed and responded to all correspondence relating to this matter”, including from police, adding: “We have also concluded that no further action will be taken on behalf of the council.”\n",
      "Rayner said: “We have seen the Conservative party use this playbook before – reporting political opponents to the police during election campaigns to distract from their dire record. I am grateful to all those who have stood by and supported me and my family.”\n",
      "Keir Starmer said he was “obviously pleased”, adding: “I never doubted that Angela hadn’t done anything wrong.”\n",
      "Starmer was subject to his own police investigation over alleged wrongdoing, one also heavily pushed by Conservative MPs. He and Rayner were cleared in 2022 by Durham police after claims they broke lockdown rules by having beer and a takeaway curry with Labour staff in 2021.\n",
      "Michael Barton, the former chief constable of Durham police,said such inquiries were concerning. “When did party politicians start thinking it was a good idea to pressurise the police – sometimes it looks like a commission – into fanciful investigations when the police are under such huge strain?\n",
      "“It boils down to trying to use the police to embarrass their political rivals and they should know better. I can see the pressure chief constables are under from senior politicians and certain allies in the media.”\n",
      "In 2007, before Rayner was an MP, she bought the £79,000 property using the right-to-buy scheme, getting a 25% discount off the property’s asking price. A year later Rayner had a second child, with her then-partner Mark Rayner, a Unison official. He already owned a home about a mile away.\n",
      "Their son was born prematurely and spent eight months in intensive care. The couple kept their separate properties during this period. In 2010, they got married, a year after having their second child.\n",
      "In March 2015, Rayner sold her home for £127,500, making a profit of £48,500. Because it was designated as her main residence, the profit was not liable for capital gains tax. The allegation by some Conservatives was that this was misleading, as she primarily lived at her then-husband’s address.\n",
      "Married couples who have individual properties can have only one main residence between them under tax law. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, has been formally cleared of any criminal wrongdoing following allegations that she avoided tax obligations related to the sale of her former council house in 2015. The decision by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) brings an end to a politically charged investigation that had been heavily promoted by Conservative MPs, with Rayner condemning their actions as \"desperate tactics\" designed to smear her reputation.  \n",
      "In a detailed statement, GMP confirmed that after a comprehensive review, they found no grounds for further action. The police clarified that issues concerning capital gains tax or council tax fall outside their jurisdiction, though they had shared their findings with Stockport Council and HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Sources indicate that neither authority intends to pursue the matter further, effectively closing the case.  \n",
      "The controversy centered on claims that Rayner had improperly designated the property as her primary residence when selling it, thereby avoiding capital gains tax. Under UK tax law, married couples can only nominate one main residence between them, and critics alleged that Rayner had misrepresented her living arrangements to secure a tax advantage. The property, purchased in 2007 under the right-to-buy scheme for £79,000, was sold in 2015 for £127,500—a profit of £48,500.  \n",
      "Rayner had previously vowed to step down as deputy leader if found to have broken the law, a pledge that underscored her confidence in her innocence. In response to the police decision, she accused the Conservatives of weaponizing law enforcement for political gain. \"We have seen the Conservative Party use this playbook before—reporting political opponents to the police during election campaigns to distract from their dire record,\" she said. \"I am grateful to all those who have stood by and supported me and my family.\"  \n",
      "Labour leader Keir Starmer echoed her relief, stating, \"I never doubted that Angela hadn’t done anything wrong.\" Starmer himself faced similar scrutiny in 2022 when he and Rayner were investigated—and later cleared—by Durham Police over allegations of breaching lockdown rules by sharing a meal with colleagues during the pandemic.  \n",
      "The case has reignited concerns about the politicization of police investigations. Michael Barton, former Chief Constable of Durham Police, criticized the trend of politicians pressuring law enforcement to target rivals. \"When did party politicians start thinking it was a good idea to pressurize the police into fanciful investigations when they are under such huge strain?\" he asked. \"It boils down to trying to use the police to embarrass their political opponents, and they should know better.\"  \n",
      "Rayner’s personal circumstances at the time of the property sale added complexity to the allegations. She and her then-husband, Mark Rayner, a Unison official, maintained separate residences for a period while their son, born prematurely, required extended hospitalization. The couple married in 2010, a year after the birth of their second child, but tax experts note that the rules on principal residence declarations are stringent, requiring clear evidence of occupancy.  \n",
      "HMRC, which conducted its own review at Rayner’s request, confirmed that no capital gains tax liability existed, reinforcing the police’s conclusion. Stockport Council also confirmed it had reviewed the matter and found no grounds for action.  \n",
      "The episode highlights the increasingly adversarial nature of British politics, where accusations of financial impropriety are frequently weaponized. Legal analysts suggest that while scrutiny of public figures is necessary, the misuse of police resources for partisan ends risks undermining public trust in both political and judicial institutions.  \n",
      "For now, Rayner’s political standing appears undiminished, though the controversy may linger as a talking point in the run-up to the next general election. As one Labour insider remarked, \"This was always a politically motivated attack, and the outcome proves it had no substance. But it’s a reminder of how ugly politics can get.\" \n",

      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: Angela Rayner let out a visible sigh of relief this week as Greater Manchester Police (GMP) closed their investigation into allegations she avoided tax on the 2015 sale of her former council home—a saga that had become a political lightning rod. \"No further action will be taken,\" read the terse police statement on Tuesday, drawing a line under months of Conservative-led pressure that Rayner branded a \"smear campaign.\"\n",
      "The deputy Labour leader, known for her sharp wit and working-class roots, had faced claims she improperly declared her ex-council house in Stockport as her primary residence when selling it for £127,500—a £48,500 profit from its 2007 purchase price under right-to-buy. At issue was whether she and then-husband Mark Rayner, a Unison official, had correctly navigated capital gains tax rules requiring married couples to nominate a single main residence.\n",
      "\"Complete nonsense from start to finish,\" Rayner told reporters outside Parliament, flanked by Labour colleagues. \"The Tories knew this was a dead-end, but they pushed it anyway to distract from their own failures.\" Her voice cracked as she referenced the strain on her family, particularly during the period in question when her premature son required prolonged hospital care—a detail that complicated living arrangements at the time.\n",
      "GMP’s review, launched in March after Tory MPs including James Daly (Bury North) submitted complaints, concluded within weeks that no criminal offenses were apparent. Crucially, the force noted tax matters fall to HMRC, which separately confirmed it found no liability after Rayner proactively requested scrutiny. Stockport Council likewise closed its file.\n",
      "\"This was always a fishing expedition,\" said Dan Neidle, founder of the Tax Policy Associates think tank. \"The rules on principal private residence relief are complex, but there’s no evidence here of deliberate misdeclaration.\" Neidle pointed to documentation showing Rayner had legitimately shifted residency to her husband’s home in nearby Lowndes Lane after their 2010 marriage.\n",
      "Conservative critics remained unmoved. \"Proper due diligence was needed given the sums involved,\" insisted Treasury committee chair Harriett Baldwin, though she conceded the police’s decision \"must be respected.\" The tension echoes 2022’s \"Beergate\" affair, when Durham Police investigated—and cleared—Rayner and Keir Starmer over a lockdown-era curry.\n",
      "Former Durham Chief Constable Michael Barton voiced dismay at the trend: \"Since when do politicians think it’s acceptable to waste police time scoring points? These referrals are becoming a dangerous habit.\" His warning carries weight—GMP reportedly spent over 120 officer hours on the case amid record response delays to burglaries and violent crimes in Manchester.\n",
      "For Rayner, the resolution marks both vindication and a cautionary tale. \"They came for me because I’m a working-class woman who dares to challenge the establishment,\" she told a rally in Salford last night, to raucous applause. Yet with a general election looming, allies admit the episode may leave scars. As one shadow cabinet member privately conceded: \"The mud sticks even when the claims don’t stand up. That’s modern politics.\"\n",
      "The broader implications trouble governance experts. \"We’re normalizing weaponization of state institutions,\" warned Professor Meg Russell of UCL’s Constitution Unit. \"Scrutiny matters, but when investigations become political tools, everyone loses faith in the system.\"\n",
      "As Westminster’s attention shifts, Rayner’s team confirms she’s drafting formal complaints against several Tory MPs for \"malicious representations.\" But for now, the woman tipped as a future Labour leader is back on the front foot—her trademark red lipstick and sharper-than-ever tongue intact. \n",

[ID 5] Статья после третьего изменения: Angela Rayner will face no further police action following an investigation into allegations she avoided tax on the sale of her former council house in 2015, Greater Manchester Police confirmed this week. The decision brings to a close a months-long inquiry that had drawn significant political attention, with Labour dismissing the claims as baseless while Conservative critics maintained the need for scrutiny.  \n",
      "The allegations centered on whether Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, had correctly declared her ex-council property in Stockport as her primary residence when selling it for £127,500—a substantial profit from its original purchase price under the right-to-buy scheme. Questions were raised about capital gains tax obligations, particularly concerning her marital status at the time. Rayner married her then-husband, Mark Rayner, a Unison official, in 2010, and tax rules require married couples to nominate a single main residence.  \n",
      "GMP launched its review in March after receiving complaints from Conservative MPs, including James Daly, the member for Bury North. The police force concluded its assessment swiftly, stating that no criminal offenses had been identified. A spokesperson noted that tax matters fall under the jurisdiction of HM Revenue and Customs, which separately confirmed it had found no outstanding liabilities after Rayner voluntarily requested a review of her tax affairs. Stockport Council also confirmed it had closed its own inquiry.  \n",
      "Rayner welcomed the outcome, describing the allegations as politically motivated. \"This was always a distraction from the government’s failures,\" she said in a statement. \"The police have now confirmed what I’ve said all along—there was no case to answer.\" She has consistently denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that she complied with all legal and tax requirements at the time of the sale.  \n",
      "Tax experts weighed in on the technicalities of the case. Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates, said the rules governing principal private residence relief are complex but noted that available documentation supported Rayner’s position. \"There’s no evidence of deliberate misdeclaration,\" he said. \"This was a legitimate sale under the rules as they stood.\"  \n",
      "Conservative figures, however, defended their decision to pursue the matter. Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said proper scrutiny was necessary given the sums involved, though she acknowledged the police’s decision should be accepted. The episode has drawn comparisons to the 2022 \"Beergate\" investigation, in which Rayner and Labour leader Keir Starmer were cleared by Durham Police over allegations of breaching lockdown rules.  \n",
      "Criticism has also been directed at the broader trend of political referrals to law enforcement. Michael Barton, former Chief Constable of Durham Police, expressed concern over the increasing use of police investigations as political tools. \"These referrals risk undermining public trust in institutions when they’re used for partisan purposes,\" he said.  \n",
      "The case has reignited debates about the intersection of politics and accountability. Professor Meg Russell of UCL’s Constitution Unit warned against the normalization of using state mechanisms for political gain. \"Scrutiny is essential, but when investigations become weaponized, it erodes confidence in the system,\" she said.  \n",
      "With the matter now resolved, Rayner’s team has indicated she may pursue formal complaints against some of her Conservative critics. The episode, while concluded, has underscored the heightened scrutiny facing political figures—particularly those, like Rayner, who occupy prominent roles in opposition. As the political landscape shifts toward a general election, the fallout from such investigations may continue to influence public and political discourse.  \n",
      "For now, the focus returns to policy and campaigning, with Rayner expected to resume her frontline role in Labour’s election strategy. The party has sought to frame the investigation as an example of political gamesmanship, while the Conservatives maintain that transparency and accountability remain paramount in public life. \n",

       "'The UK general election campaign has been unexpectedly dominated by foreign policy, particularly the conflict in Gaza, presenting a significant challenge for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. His cautious stance on the issue has alienated segments of the party’s traditional voter base, raising concerns about electoral fallout in key constituencies. With the conflict showing no signs of resolution, Labour’s internal divisions and external pressures highlight the broader geopolitical tensions shaping British politics.\\nLabour’s position on Gaza has become a focal point of public frustration. Reports from campaign trails indicate that constituents are confronting candidates with images of devastation in Rafah, demanding clearer condemnation of Israeli military actions. The issue has already had tangible political consequences: in May, twelve Labour councillors in Oldham resigned in protest over the party’s stance, signalling deep discontent within local branches.\\nJess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, acknowledged the intensity of voter sentiment, noting that constituents are not merely angry but deeply disappointed—a more politically damaging reaction. This disillusionment risks eroding support in traditionally safe Labour seats, particularly in areas with significant Muslim populations.\\nLabour’s internal strife has been compounded by legal and diplomatic controversies. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy’s assertion that Labour would enforce International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants against Israeli leaders if they entered the UK sparked immediate backlash. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps condemned the statement as “dangerous posturing,” while Labour MP Liam Byrne warned it could undermine peace negotiations.\\nThe party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting last month reportedly descended into heated debate, with union representatives arguing that Labour could not dismiss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza without political consequences. Simultaneously, Jewish Labour members expressed concerns that antisemitism was being weaponized in the debate, reflecting the delicate balance the leadership must strike.\\nSir Keir Starmer has struggled to articulate a coherent position. When pressed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby on whether the UK should continue arms sales to Israel while calling for restraint in Rafah, his response—emphasizing the role of international institutions—appeared evasive. This ambiguity has left Labour vulnerable to accusations of inconsistency.\\nLeaked Foreign Office documents further complicate matters, revealing bureaucratic and legal obstacles to halting arms exports to Israel. One memo reportedly warned that the UK’s arms licensing system lacks the flexibility for swift policy shifts. Another suggested that Gulf states, frustrated with British diplomacy, are increasingly bypassing the UK in favour of direct engagement with Washington and Beijing.\\nThe human toll of the conflict continues to influence public discourse. British medical professionals returning from Gaza have described harrowing conditions, including surgeries performed without anaesthesia. Advocacy groups such as Medact have amplified these accounts, pressuring MPs to take a stronger stance.\\nWith Labour widely expected to win the July 4 election, the party must prepare for immediate foreign policy challenges. Whitehall contingency plans reportedly include proposals for a Royal Navy-led humanitarian sea corridor and the potential recall of the UK’s ambassador to Israel if settlement expansion continues—a measure last taken in 2014.\\nThe real test for Labour will come after the election. Diplomatic sources suggest the ICC may issue further arrest warrants related to the conflict by autumn, while the UN General Assembly is expected to vote on Palestinian statehood shortly after the UK election. Sir Keir Starmer’s early decisions on these issues could define his premiership, determining whether he stabilizes Labour’s foreign policy stance or faces immediate backlash.\\nAs the campaign enters its final stages, Labour’s handling of the Gaza crisis remains a critical vulnerability—one that could shape not only the election outcome but also the party’s long-term credibility on the international stage.'"

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 3 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated journalism, with editorial suggestions for improvement:1. **Overuse of Polling Data as Structural Crutch**     *Issue*: The article leans heavily on polling percentages (e.g., \"52% of respondents oppose\") as its primary narrative device, creating a mechanical rhythm where each paragraph begins with data rather than human stakes.     *Suggestion*: Lead with vivid stakeholder voices or concrete policy consequences first, then use polling to contextualize. For example, open the national service section with a quote from an 18-year-old potential conscript before citing opposition statistics.  2. **Neutral-Summary Syndrome**     *Issue*: Every policy debate is presented as a symmetrical \"some say X while others say Y\" dichotomy without editorial prioritization or investigative depth (e.g., the private school VAT debate lacks specific cost impacts or historical context).     *Suggestion*: Replace generic \"supporters argue/opponents warn\" phrasing with reported details—e.g., \"Headteachers at 30 private schools told the Telegraph the policy could force fees up by £2,000 annually\" or \"Labour cites IFS research showing the measure would disproportionately affect the wealthiest 7% of families.\"  3. **Demographic Generalizations Without Grounding**     *Issue*: Phrases like \"younger demographics question the policy's relevance\" or \"older voters cite income security\" rely on broad, unsourced attributions that read like algorithmic demographic assumptions rather than reported insights.     *Suggestion*: Attribute claims to specific interviews or focus group findings (e.g., \"At a Leeds youth forum, 18 of 20 participants called national service 'out of touch with job market realities'\") or use qualitative data from the pollster's methodology notes.  **Bonus Structural Note**: The conclusion's \"political analysts suggest\" is a classic LLM hedge. Replace with named experts (e.g., \"Prof. Meg Russell of UCL's Constitution Unit\") or specific historical parallels (e.g., \"Similar policy divides preceded Thatcher's 1979 victory\").  These changes would shift the piece from a competent but generic overview to journalism with reported texture and editorial perspective. \n",

At a Manchester youth employment center, 19-year-old Aisha Patel scoffs as she reads about the plan on her phone. \"They want us to drop everything for a year when most of my mates are scrambling for apprenticeships or second jobs just to pay rent,\" she says, echoing sentiments heard in focus groups from Bristol to Newcastle. Official polling confirms this skepticism—52% oppose the policy—but the numbers don’t capture the visceral reaction from young people who see it as a distraction from housing and job crises.

Meanwhile, Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees has sent shockwaves through the sector. St. Andrew’s College in Surrey estimates fees would rise by £2,100 annually, pricing out families like the Harrisons, whose daughter has dyslexia. \"We’re not millionaires—just parents trying to get her the support state schools couldn’t provide,\" says father Mark, a civil servant.  \n",

      "As manifestos land this week, Prof. Tim Bale of Queen Mary University observes a deeper ideological fault line: \"The Tories are betting on cultural conservatism resonating more than economic anxiety, while Labour’s gambling that voters want radical change after 14 years of squeezed services.\" Historical parallels loom—similar education and national service debates preceded Thatcher’s 1979 victory—but with living standards stagnating, this election may turn on which party convinces Britons they can deliver both stability and renewal.  \n",

Official polling confirms this skepticism—52% oppose the policy—but the numbers don’t capture the visceral reaction from young people who see it as a distraction from, you know, actual problems. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps insists the policy would \"build social cohesion,\" though he said it while standing next to a visibly bored aide shuffling papers like they were playing solitaire.

At a Kent retirement community, 72-year-old Margaret Trent calls it non-negotiable, adjusting her glasses with hands that still smell faintly of lavender hand cream. \"My heating bill’s doubled, and my pension’s the only thing keeping me from choosing between food and prescriptions,\" she says, before launching into a story about her cat’s birthday (April 1st, \"which explains his personality\").  \n",

      "7. [ID 9] Статья после шестого изменения: As Britain’s general election campaign intensifies, debates over key policy proposals—from national service to education reforms and pension protections—are shaping the political landscape. These discussions extend beyond Westminster, resonating in communities where voters weigh the practical implications of party pledges against their daily realities.\n",
      "The Conservative Party’s proposal to reintroduce a form of national service has drawn sharp criticism, particularly among younger voters. The policy, framed as a means to foster social cohesion, would require 18-year-olds to undertake either military training or community service for a year. However, polling indicates that 52% of the public opposes the plan, with skepticism particularly pronounced among those it would directly affect.\n",
      "At a youth employment center in Manchester, 19-year-old Aisha Patel expressed frustration, noting that many of her peers are already struggling to secure stable employment or affordable housing. \"This feels like a distraction from the real issues we’re facing,\" she said. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has defended the policy, but even some Conservative backbenchers have privately acknowledged its controversial reception, with one describing its rollout as \"poorly executed.\"\n",
      "Education policy has also emerged as a contentious battleground. The Conservative government’s plan to reduce funding for university courses deemed \"low-value\"—based on graduate earnings—has drawn criticism from academics. Dr. Eleanor Yates, an English department head at a Midlands university, argued that measuring the worth of a degree solely by early-career salaries overlooks the long-term benefits of humanities education.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Labour’s proposal to impose VAT on private school fees has unsettled parents who rely on independent institutions for specialist support. Mark Harrison, a civil servant whose daughter attends a private school due to dyslexia provisions, warned that the additional costs could price out middle-income families. \"We’re not wealthy,\" he said. \"We just needed an option that state schools couldn’t provide.\"\n",
      "With pensioners representing a highly engaged voting bloc—78% of over-65s turned out in 2019—both major parties have pledged to maintain the \"triple lock,\" which ensures state pensions rise in line with inflation, wages, or by 2.5%, whichever is highest. For many retirees, this guarantee is non-negotiable.\n",
      "Margaret Trent, a 72-year-old from Kent, emphasized the policy’s importance amid rising living costs. \"My pension is the only thing keeping me from choosing between heating and prescriptions,\" she said. The political sensitivity surrounding pensions underscores the electoral risks of alienating older voters.\n",
      "Beyond the major parties, smaller political groups are capitalizing on localized grievances. In Cornwall, the Liberal Democrats have gained traction by highlighting the scarcity of NHS dental services, a pressing issue in rural areas. Local candidate Sarah Bennett pointed to the nearest available practice being a 90-minute drive away—a challenge for residents in need of routine care. Such targeted campaigning has already yielded results, with the Lib Dems flipping four council seats in the region last year.\n",
      "Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University noted a deepening ideological divide between the two main parties. \"The Conservatives are banking on cultural conservatism resonating more than economic concerns,\" he observed, \"while Labour is betting on public appetite for change after 14 years of austerity and strained public services.\"\n",
      "The election may ultimately hinge on which party can convincingly promise both stability and renewal—particularly as stagnant living standards and crumbling infrastructure fuel voter frustration. For many, abstract policy debates matter less than tangible improvements. As Aisha Patel put it: \"People just want practical solutions—like reliable public transport.\"\n",
      "The true measure of this election will not be found in polls alone but in the lived experiences of voters assessing which party can address their most pressing concerns. Whether debating national service, education funding, or pension security, Britons are weighing political promises against personal circumstances—and the outcome will reflect which vision aligns closest with their daily realities. \n",

      "6. [ID 8] Статья после пятого изменения: The hidden camera footage hit like a grenade in Clacton’s already heated political battle—or at least, that’s what the news anchors keep saying. There, caught in unguarded moments, Reform UK campaigners Andrew Parker and George Jones spewed the kind of rhetoric that sends party spin doctors scrambling for damage control. Parker, a local activist with a habit of drumming his fingers on whatever surface was nearby—this time, a laminated menu at the pub—didn’t just criticize Rishi Sunak’s policies. He deployed a racial slur against Britain’s first Hindu prime minister, calling him \"wet\" and \"useless\" between sips of beer. Then came the kicker: a suggestion to station snipers on Dover’s cliffs to \"pick off\" migrants crossing the Channel. Classic Tuesday night pub talk, right?  \n",
      "But the recordings, obtained by Channel 4’s undercover team (who probably had to sit through hours of boring small talk about the weather first), didn’t stop there. Veteran organizer George Jones, who’d helped orchestrate Nigel Farage’s rallies while nursing an inexplicable obsession with collecting vintage beer mats, erupted at the sight of a police car flying a Pride flag. \"Bring back the noose for that lot,\" he muttered, sparking immediate fury from LGBTQ+ advocates. Stonewall’s response was blistering, but honestly, what did they expect? \"This isn’t just one bad apple—it’s a pattern of hatred that Reform’s leadership has cultivated through years of divisive rhetoric,\" they said, sounding about as surprised as someone finding out water is wet.  \n",
      "Farage’s damage-limitation press conference felt like déjà vu—like, didn’t we just do this last week? Flanked by stone-faced aides who probably hadn’t slept in 48 hours, he axed both men within hours, calling their views \"repugnant.\" Yet critics noted the irony—ain’t nobody got time for pretending this is new. The same party that built its brand on inflammatory immigration ads now pleading ignorance about its supporters’ extremes. \"They’ve spent years pouring gasoline on racial tensions,\" said Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain, fiddling with a loose thread on his blazer sleeve, \"and now they’re shocked when someone lights a match?\"  \n",
      "The timing couldn’t be worse. With polls showing Reform bleeding Conservative votes like a sieve with extra holes, the Clacton scandal threatens to derail Farage’s carefully crafted rebrand as a mainstream insurgent. It’s not the first crisis—just the ugliest in a string of them. Last week, a Reform candidate quit over ties to neo-Nazi groups (whoops); another faces scrutiny for calling asylum seekers \"vermin\" (double whoops). Party officials like Lee Anderson dismiss these as isolated cases, but the pattern is hard to ignore. As one former Tory voter in Clacton told me outside a rain-lashed campaign office, her umbrella half-collapsed in the wind: \"I wanted change, not this kind of ugliness. And also, why is there always a weird smell near these campaign vans?\"  \n",
      "What’s chilling isn’t just the remarks themselves, but how casually they were dropped—like, between bites of a sandwich and a debate over whether the pub’s WiFi was slower than usual. Parker didn’t whisper his sniper fantasy—he said it laughing, as if discussing football tactics. Jones’ homophobic outburst came while he absentmindedly spun a half-empty ketchup bottle on the table. This normalization of extremism has rattled Clacton’s diverse communities. At the town’s only mosque, Imam Hassan Farooq described congregants asking if they should avoid voting day, their voices hushed over the sound of a malfunctioning AC unit in the corner. \"When people hear ‘send them back’ from campaigners, they wonder who ‘them’ includes,\" he said, trailing off like he wasn’t sure he wanted to finish the thought.  \n",
      "The fallout may hinge on whether voters see this as a slip-up or a reveal. Reform’s base might shrug it off as \"telling it like it is,\" but moderates are balking. At a seafront chip shop, retiree Margaret Ellis pushed her plaice around the plate—seriously, who orders plaice?—as she spoke: \"I liked Nigel’s straight talk on immigration, but this? It’s not politics—it’s poison. Also, these chips are too soggy.\"  \n",
      "As the election looms, Farage faces a brutal calculus: rein in his movement’s worst instincts and risk alienating the faithful, or keep winking at the fringe and scare off the swing voters he desperately needs. Meanwhile, the Channel 4 footage keeps circulating, each reshare a fresh indictment—like that one embarrassing photo from secondary school that somehow resurfaces every few years. For Clacton, a town already synonymous with Brexit’s divisions, the tapes aren’t just a scandal—they’re a mirror held up to Britain’s fraying political decorum. And as one defected Reform volunteer put it before walking away, tripping slightly on a loose paving stone: \"You can’t unhear what these people really think. Also, has anyone seen my keys?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "7. [ID 9] Статья после шестого изменения: The emergence of undercover footage showing Reform UK campaigners making inflammatory remarks has intensified scrutiny of the party’s rhetoric and internal culture. The recordings, obtained by Channel 4, captured activists Andrew Parker and George Jones using racially charged language against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and advocating extreme measures against migrants, as well as making homophobic comments. The revelations have prompted swift condemnation, raising concerns about the party’s ability to distance itself from extremist elements while maintaining its electoral momentum.\n",
      "The footage, filmed in a Clacton pub, shows Parker, a local campaigner, dismissing Sunak with a racial slur and suggesting that snipers be deployed along the Dover coastline to target migrants crossing the Channel. Meanwhile, Jones, a veteran organizer with ties to Nigel Farage’s previous campaigns, was recorded making derogatory remarks about LGBTQ+ individuals after seeing a police car displaying a Pride flag. The comments, delivered in casual conversation, have drawn sharp criticism from advocacy groups and political opponents alike.\n",
      "Farage moved quickly to expel both individuals from the party, describing their views as \"repugnant\" during a hastily arranged press conference. However, critics argue that the incident reflects deeper issues within Reform UK, pointing to a pattern of inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and social issues. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain noted the irony of the party’s leadership expressing shock at the remarks, given its history of stoking divisive narratives. \"They have spent years amplifying hostility toward minorities,\" he said, \"and now they are surprised when their supporters echo those sentiments?\"\n",
      "The controversy comes at a critical juncture for Reform UK, which has been gaining traction in polls at the expense of the Conservatives. However, the party has faced a series of setbacks in recent weeks, including the resignation of a candidate linked to far-right groups and another under fire for dehumanizing language about asylum seekers. While senior figures such as Lee Anderson have dismissed these incidents as isolated, the frequency of such controversies has led to questions about whether the party can effectively police its own ranks.\n",
      "The impact on public opinion remains uncertain. Some voters may dismiss the remarks as the actions of a few individuals, while others could see them as indicative of a broader culture within the party. In Clacton, a town with a history of political polarization, reactions have been mixed. Local resident Margaret Ellis, who had previously supported Reform’s stance on immigration, expressed dismay at the footage. \"There’s a difference between strong opinions and outright bigotry,\" she said.\n",
      "The incident has also unsettled minority communities. At a mosque in Clacton, Imam Hassan Farooq reported that some congregants were anxious about the political climate. \"When they hear rhetoric about sending people back, they wonder if they are included in that message,\" he said. The sense of unease underscores the broader societal tensions that the election campaign has brought to the surface.\n",
      "For Farage, the challenge is balancing the need to appeal to disillusioned Conservative voters while preventing further reputational damage. If Reform UK is to solidify its position as a credible alternative to the major parties, it must demonstrate that it can curb extremist elements within its ranks. Yet, doing so risks alienating its core supporters, who have been drawn to its uncompromising stance on issues such as immigration.\n",
      "The fallout from the Clacton recordings extends beyond immediate political consequences. The casual nature of the remarks—delivered in everyday conversation—has highlighted concerns about the normalization of extremist views in public discourse. Analysts suggest that the incident may serve as a litmus test for how far populist movements can push boundaries before facing electoral backlash.\n",
      "As the campaign progresses, the pressure on Reform UK to clarify its ideological direction will only intensify. The party’s ability to navigate this controversy—and whether it can convince voters that it represents a constructive alternative rather than a vehicle for division—will be crucial in determining its future influence in British politics. For now, the Clacton footage stands as a stark reminder of the challenges facing a political landscape increasingly shaped by polarization and populism. \n",

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: A Reform UK activist in the constituency where Nigel Farage is standing has been secretly filmed making extremely racist comments about Rishi Sunak, as well as using Islamophobic and other offensive language.\n",
      "Farage said he was “dismayed” by the views expressed by Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, who was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News.\n",
      "The channel also secretly filmed George Jones, a longtime party activist who organises events for Farage, making homophobic comments, calling the Pride flag “degenerate” and LGBT people “nonces”.\n",
      "The emergence of the footage, filming of which concluded last week, comes on the same day that Reform dropped an election candidate in another seat, after the Guardian informed the party that Raymond Saint had been on a list of members of the British National party.\n",
      "The most serious comments uncovered by Channel 4 News involved Parker, who was covertly filmed making them while canvassing and travelling by car around Clacton, where Farage is the favourite to unseat the incumbent Conservative.\n",
      "During one journey, Parker described Sunak as “fucking [P-word]”. He said: “I’ve always been a Tory voter, but what annoys me is that fucking [P-word] we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. Fucking useless.”\n",
      "Telling the reporter, who was posing as an activist, to “emphasise ‘illegal’” if discussing migration with minority ethnic voters, Parker called Islam “a cult”, saying: “We’re fucking kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoon’s.”\n",
      "In one doorstep conversation with a voter, Parker suggests shooting asylum seekers who try to come to England on small boats. “You’ve got Deal, haven’t you,” he says, referring to the town in Kent. “The place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them.”\n",
      "In another covertly filmed exchange, at a pub in Clacton, Jones reacts with scorn when he sees a police car going past displaying a Pride flag. He says: “You see that fucking degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.”\n",
      "Later, explaining what he says would be policies for a future Reform government, Jones says: “Our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police,” and that the party should “bring back the noose”.\n",
      "In a statement to Channel 4 News, Parker said Farage and Reform were not aware of his views, and he was sorry if they “have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute”.\n",
      "“I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform party are aware of my personal views on immigration,” he said. “Any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage.”\n",
      "Farage said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.\n",
      "“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\n",
      "While the party swiftly distanced itself from the rhetoric, it is the latest in a series of controversies in which Reform candidates or other party figures have been shown to have said offensive things or held extreme views.\n",
      "This month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP.\n",
      "The party has not yet appeared to have taken any action against its candidate in Southend East and Rochford who was reported as having said arriving asylum seekers should be “slaughtered”.\n",

[ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: The Reform UK party has been embroiled in fresh controversy after undercover footage revealed activists making deeply offensive remarks, including racist slurs against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and inflammatory comments about Muslims and the LGBTQ+ community. The revelations, captured by Channel 4 News, have cast a shadow over Nigel Farage’s campaign in Clacton, where he is the frontrunner to unseat the Conservative incumbent.  \n",
      "Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, was recorded using a racial slur to describe Sunak, calling him a “fucking [P-word]” and dismissing him as “wet” and “useless.” Parker, who claimed to have previously voted Conservative, went further by advocating for extreme measures against asylum seekers, suggesting they should be shot upon arrival. “Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them,” he said in the footage. His remarks extended to Islam, which he derided as “a cult,” proposing that mosques be converted into Wetherspoon’s pubs.  \n",
      "In a separate recording, George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage, was filmed making homophobic comments. Reacting to a police car displaying a Pride flag, Jones called it a “degenerate flag” and criticized officers for promoting “that crap” instead of focusing on crime. He went on to suggest that under a future Reform government, police would operate as “paramilitaries” and advocated for the return of capital punishment, stating the party should “bring back the noose.”  \n",
      "Farage swiftly condemned the remarks, expressing dismay and distancing himself and the party from the activists’ views. “The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters, or Reform UK policy,” he said. Both Parker and Jones have since been disassociated from the campaign.  \n",
      "Parker later issued a statement claiming his comments were personal and not reflective of Reform’s stance. “At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage,” he said.  \n",
      "The scandal comes on the heels of other controversies involving Reform candidates. Earlier this month, Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it emerged he had previously encouraged support for the far-right British National Party (BNP). Meanwhile, Leslie Lilley, the party’s candidate for Southend East and Rochford, faced scrutiny after reports surfaced of a 2020 Facebook post in which he allegedly called for asylum seekers to be “slaughtered” and referred to them as “scum.”  \n",
      "Political analysts suggest the repeated incidents raise questions about Reform’s vetting processes and the broader culture within the party. Dr. Sarah Harrison, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Essex, noted, “While Farage has been quick to disavow these individuals, the frequency of such incidents suggests a pattern. It undermines Reform’s attempts to present itself as a credible alternative to the mainstream parties.”  \n",
      "The timing of the revelations is particularly damaging for Farage, who has sought to position Reform as a disciplined, policy-driven force ahead of the general election. Critics argue that the party’s rhetoric on immigration and social issues has attracted figures with extremist views, despite leadership attempts to project moderation.  \n",
      "As the fallout continues, Reform faces mounting pressure to address internal divisions and reassure voters that it can maintain discipline among its ranks. With the election looming, the party’s ability to navigate these controversies may prove decisive in shaping its electoral prospects. \n",

      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: The undercover footage hits like a gut punch: a Reform UK activist leaning against a garden fence in Clacton, casually dropping racial slurs about Rishi Sunak between drags on a cigarette. \"Fucking P-word,\" Andrew Parker mutters to a fellow canvasser, his voice dripping with contempt for Britain's first Hindu prime minister. \"Wet. Useless.\" The Channel 4 sting operation has plunged Nigel Farage's insurgent campaign into crisis just as he eyes victory in this coastal constituency, exposing a rot that runs deeper than isolated remarks.\n",
      "Parker's tirade—captured on hidden camera—escalates from racist vitriol to chilling proposals. \"Get young recruits with guns on the fucking beach,\" he says of Channel migrants, miming rifle shots with his hands. \"Target practice.\" The 45-year-old former Tory voter then turns his fire on Islam (\"a cult\") with a pub landlord's solution: \"Turn all the mosques into Wetherspoon's.\" The footage's mundanity unsettles most—this isn't a shadowy backroom exchange, but broad daylight conversation in a seaside town.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in a separate recording that could have been lifted from 1970s-era bigotry, veteran Reform organizer George Jones erupts at a Pride-flagged police car. \"Degenerate flag!\" the 78-year-old spits, his face contorted. Jones—who's arranged multiple Farage rallies—dreams aloud of paramilitary policing and \"bringing back the noose\" under Reform rule. His hands tremble with rage as he condemns officers for promoting \"that crap\" instead of fighting crime.\n",
      "The backlash came swift and fierce. \"These disgusting comments make me want to vomit,\" said Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain, his voice cracking during a BBC interview. LGBTQ+ advocacy group Stonewall issued a scathing statement: \"When your activists call for our hanging, 'disassociation' isn't enough—we need to see real accountability.\" Local imam Hassan Ali told The Guardian his mosque had received a deluge of supportive messages, but added: \"This poison has been legitimized by years of demonizing rhetoric.\"\n",
      "Farage moved quickly to contain the damage, his trademark smirk absent during a tense press conference. \"These vile opinions belong in the sewer, not in my party,\" he insisted, though his denunciation rang hollow for many. The Reform leader—who once warned of \"Muslim ghettoes\" and called for a \"points-based\" immigration system—has long danced along the edge of inflammatory rhetoric. As Dr. Sarah Harrison of Essex University noted: \"You can't sow the wind for decades then act shocked when you reap the whirlwind.\"\n",
      "Both offenders were swiftly cut loose. Parker claimed his remarks were \"private opinions,\" while Jones disappeared into the Essex countryside, his cottage curtains drawn against reporters. But the damage may already be done—YouGov tracking shows Reform's support among Muslim voters has cratered to 2% since the scandal broke.\n",
      "This isn't Reform's first rodeo with extremism. Just last week, candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong quit after his past BNP support surfaced, while Southend hopeful Leslie Lilley faces scrutiny over alleged Facebook posts calling asylum seekers \"scum\" to be \"slaughtered.\" The pattern raises uncomfortable questions: is this a party struggling with vetting, or one whose anti-establishment branding acts as a dog whistle?\n",
      "Reform's communications director, former Tory MP Lee Anderson, insists the incidents are outliers. \"We've got 600 candidates—you're bound to get a few bad apples,\" he told Sky News. But opposition leaders aren't buying it. Labour's David Lammy drew parallels to Trump's MAGA movement: \"They pretend to disown the racists at 3 p.m., then retweet them by midnight.\"\n",
      "As the July 4 election looms, the stakes couldn't be higher. Polls suggest Reform could siphon enough Tory votes to hand Labour a landslide—but these revelations risk alienating the moderate conservatives Farage needs. In Clacton's working-class pubs, reactions are mixed. \"Nigel should chuck these nutters in the sea,\" said electrician Dave Wilkins, 58, over a pint. But retired fisherman Mick O'Leary shrugged: \"They're just saying what we're all thinking.\"\n",
      "One thing's certain: the footage has given Britain an unvarnished look at the ugliness thriving in politics' shadows. Whether voters turn away in disgust or nod along in agreement may determine not just Reform's fate, but the tone of British democracy itself. \n",

      "4.2. [ID 5] Статья после третьего изменения: Undercover footage obtained by Channel 4 has revealed inflammatory remarks by activists campaigning for Reform UK in Clacton, casting a shadow over Nigel Farage's parliamentary bid. The recordings capture Andrew Parker, a local campaigner, using racial slurs against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak while canvassing in the coastal constituency.  \n",
      "In the footage, Parker refers to Sunak using a derogatory term and describes him as \"wet\" and \"useless.\" The comments were made during casual conversations with fellow campaigners. Parker also discusses immigration, suggesting armed personnel should be deployed on beaches to target Channel migrants. His remarks extend to religious groups, with proposals to repurpose mosques into pubs.  \n",
      "A separate recording shows veteran Reform organizer George Jones reacting angrily to a police car displaying a Pride flag. Jones, who has helped arrange multiple Farage rallies, criticizes the symbol and makes references to historical forms of punishment. His comments have drawn sharp criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups.  \n",
      "The revelations prompted swift responses from community leaders and political opponents. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the language as \"deeply offensive,\" while Stonewall called for stronger accountability from political parties. Local religious leaders reported an outpouring of concern from residents, with some expressing alarm at the normalization of such rhetoric.  \n",
      "Farage moved quickly to distance himself from the activists, describing their views as \"completely unacceptable\" during a press conference. He emphasized that neither individual represented the party's values and confirmed their immediate dismissal. However, critics argue that Reform UK's broader messaging on immigration and multiculturalism has created an environment where such remarks flourish.  \n",
      "This incident follows other controversies involving Reform candidates. Last week, a prospective candidate withdrew after reports surfaced about past affiliations with far-right groups. Another candidate is under scrutiny for alleged social media posts targeting asylum seekers. These cases have raised questions about the party's candidate vetting process and whether its anti-establishment platform attracts individuals with extremist views.  \n",
      "Reform officials have dismissed the incidents as isolated. Lee Anderson, the party's communications director and a former Conservative MP, acknowledged the need for better scrutiny but maintained that the vast majority of candidates uphold appropriate standards. Opposition figures have drawn comparisons to populist movements elsewhere, suggesting that inflammatory rhetoric often persists despite official disavowals.  \n",
      "With the general election approaching, the fallout could influence voter sentiment. Polls indicate Reform UK may draw support from traditional Conservative voters, potentially reshaping the political landscape. Yet the recent controversy risks alienating moderates, complicating Farage's efforts to position his party as a viable alternative.  \n",
      "Public reaction in Clacton has been divided. Some residents expressed dismay at the language used by campaigners, while others downplayed the significance of the remarks. The broader implications remain uncertain, but the footage has intensified debates about the boundaries of political discourse in Britain.  \n",
      "As parties finalize their campaigns, the incident serves as a reminder of the challenges in maintaining civility in public life. The coming weeks will test whether Reform UK can move past the controversy—or whether it becomes a defining issue in the election. \n",

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 3 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated journalism, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  ### **1. Overuse of Neutral/Generic Transitions**  **Pattern:** Phrases like *\"The revelations prompted swift responses...\"*, *\"This incident follows other controversies...\"*, and *\"With the general election approaching...\"* create a formulaic, predictable rhythm.  **Issue:** Human journalists often vary transitions more naturally—using direct quotes, abrupt shifts, or rhetorical questions—to maintain engagement.  **Suggestion:** Replace some transitions with sharper hooks (e.g., *\"Within hours, the backlash was fierce\"* or *\"But this isn’t Reform UK’s first scandal—just the latest\"*).  ### **2. Balanced but Flat Attribution of Reactions**  **Pattern:** Quotes and responses are evenly distributed (e.g., Farage’s denial, critics’ rebuttals, community leaders’ condemnation) without clear narrative prioritization.  **Issue:** Human-written pieces often emphasize the most damning or newsworthy reactions first, rather than presenting them as a checklist.  **Suggestion:** Lead with the most explosive reaction (e.g., Stonewall’s statement) or bury less impactful ones (e.g., Lee Anderson’s boilerplate defense) deeper in the piece.  ### **3. Overly Structured \"Summary\" Ending**  **Pattern:** The closing paragraph (*\"As parties finalize their campaigns...\"*) feels like an AI-generated wrap-up, restating themes without fresh insight.  **Issue:** Human journalists often end with a punchy quote, unanswered question, or specific consequence (e.g., *\"For Clacton’s diverse residents, the footage isn’t just political noise—it’s a warning\"*).  **Suggestion:** Replace the generic conclusion with a vivid detail or forward-looking angle (e.g., *\"One Reform volunteer, who quit over the remarks, told Channel 4: ‘This isn’t the party I signed up for’\"*).  ---  **Bonus Note:** The piece is well-researched but lacks *voice*—editors could inject more urgency or stylistic flair (e.g., shorter sentences for impact, colloquialisms like *\"doubled down\"* instead of *\"maintained\"*). \n",

The revelations have prompted swift condemnation, raising concerns about the party’s ability to distance itself from extremist elements while maintaining its electoral momentum.\n",
      "The footage, filmed in a Clacton pub, shows Parker, a local campaigner, dismissing Sunak with a racial slur and suggesting that snipers be deployed along the Dover coastline to target migrants crossing the Channel. Meanwhile, Jones, a veteran organizer with ties to Nigel Farage’s previous campaigns, was recorded making derogatory remarks about LGBTQ+ individuals after seeing a police car displaying a Pride flag. The comments, delivered in casual conversation, have drawn sharp criticism from advocacy groups and political opponents alike.\n",
      "Farage moved quickly to expel both individuals from the party, describing their views as \"repugnant\" during a hastily arranged press conference. However, critics argue that the incident reflects deeper issues within Reform UK, pointing to a pattern of inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and social issues. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain noted the irony of the party’s leadership expressing shock at the remarks, given its history of stoking divisive narratives. \"They have spent years amplifying hostility toward minorities,\" he said, \"and now they are surprised when their supporters echo those sentiments?\"\n",
      "The controversy comes at a critical juncture for Reform UK, which has been gaining traction in polls at the expense of the Conservatives. However, the party has faced a series of setbacks in recent weeks, including the resignation of a candidate linked to far-right groups and another under fire for dehumanizing language about asylum seekers. While senior figures such as Lee Anderson have dismissed these incidents as isolated, the frequency of such controversies has led to questions about whether the party can effectively police its own ranks.\n",
      "The impact on public opinion remains uncertain. Some voters may dismiss the remarks as the actions of a few individuals, while others could see them as indicative of a broader culture within the party. In Clacton, a town with a history of political polarization, reactions have been mixed. Local resident Margaret Ellis, who had previously supported Reform’s stance on immigration, expressed dismay at the footage. \"There’s a difference between strong opinions and outright bigotry,\" she said.\n",
      "The incident has also unsettled minority communities. At a mosque in Clacton, Imam Hassan Farooq reported that some congregants were anxious about the political climate. \"When they hear rhetoric about sending people back, they wonder if they are included in that message,\" he said. The sense of unease underscores the broader societal tensions that the election campaign has brought to the surface.\n",
      "For Farage, the challenge is balancing the need to appeal to disillusioned Conservative voters while preventing further reputational damage. If Reform UK is to solidify its position as a credible alternative to the major parties, it must demonstrate that it can curb extremist elements within its ranks. Yet, doing so risks alienating its core supporters, who have been drawn to its uncompromising stance on issues such as immigration.\n",
      "The fallout from the Clacton recordings extends beyond immediate political consequences. The casual nature of the remarks—delivered in everyday conversation—has highlighted concerns about the normalization of extremist views in public discourse. Analysts suggest that the incident may serve as a litmus test for how far populist movements can push boundaries before facing electoral backlash.\n",
      "As the campaign progresses, the pressure on Reform UK to clarify its ideological direction will only intensify. The party’s ability to navigate this controversy—and whether it can convince voters that it represents a constructive alternative rather than a vehicle for division—will be crucial in determining its future influence in British politics. For now, the Clacton footage stands as a stark reminder of the challenges facing a political landscape increasingly shaped by polarization and populism. \n",

      "Статья до изменений (п7): The International Criminal Court's potential arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials over alleged Gaza war crimes have exposed deep international divisions. During a tense exchange with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy made clear a Labour government would honor any ICC rulings—a stance immediately condemned by Israel's allies.  \"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy declared, his voice firm as Zakaria pressed him on Labour's position. \"It's not for politicians to interfere with judicial determinations, whether domestically or internationally.\" The remark, while consistent with Labour's support for global institutions, landed like a grenade among pro-Israel factions already wary of the party's Middle East posture.  Prosecutor Karim Khan's late May announcement seeking warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders has plunged the court into its most politically charged case since its inception. Charges against Israeli officials include starvation tactics and targeting civilians, while Hamas faces accusations of crimes against humanity for hostage-taking. With ICC judges now reviewing evidence, the coming weeks could redefine the boundaries of international justice—or expose its limitations.  Washington's blistering rejection of the warrants (\"outrageous,\" per the Biden administration) contrasts sharply with Lammy's insistence that Britain, as a Rome Statute signatory, would enforce them. \"Here in the UK, we will comply, and that will be the same across Europe,\" he told Zakaria, a prediction that may prove optimistic given quiet reservations in some European capitals about the court's Gaza intervention.  The interview took unexpected turns as Zakaria pivoted to other foreign policy flashpoints. Asked about rejoining the EU, Lammy shut the door firmly: \"Unless public opinion shifts, this debate is closed.\" On Trump's possible return, he offered a surprisingly pragmatic take—suggesting the former president's deal-making instincts might preserve Ukraine aid. \"Trump doesn't like losing,\" Lammy observed. \"I doubt he'd want to see the U.S. or its allies defeated.\"  As the ICC weighs its next move, the case has become a litmus test for whether international law can withstand the pressures of great-power politics. For Lammy, it's also proving an early test of how Labour would navigate the world's most volatile crises—with principles that could exact a diplomatic cost.\n",
      "Итог обработки П8: The International Criminal Court’s potential arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his crew over alleged Gaza war crimes have turned global diplomacy into a messy, high-stakes shouting match. During a tense CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria—who kept adjusting his glasses like they were about to stage a rebellion—UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy dropped a bombshell: A Labour government would actually honor ICC rulings.  \"We, um, believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy declared, tapping his pen against a half-empty coffee cup with a faint *clink-clink-clink*. \"It’s not for politicians to, like, interfere with judicial stuff, whether it’s here or, y’know, out there.\" The remark, while technically consistent with Labour’s love for global institutions, sent pro-Israel factions into a tailspin. One Tory MP later muttered something about Lammy \"playing footsie with kangaroo courts,\" which—let’s be real—sounded more like a bad pub argument than policy critique.  Prosecutor Karim Khan’s late May announcement—seeking warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders—has plunged the ICC into its most politically radioactive case since forever. The charges? Starvation tactics, targeting civilians, and, for Hamas, crimes against humanity involving hostages. Meanwhile, judges are sifting through evidence like detectives in a Netflix true-crime doc, except the stakes are, uh, slightly higher.  Washington’s response? A blistering \"hell no.\" The Biden administration called the warrants \"outrageous,\" which, coming from a guy who once said \"c’mon, man\" to a reporter, felt almost poetic. But Lammy doubled down: \"Here in the UK, we’ll comply, and that’ll be the same across Europe.\" Bold claim, considering half of Europe’s leaders are probably sweating into their fancy espresso cups right now.  The interview took weird detours—Zakaria suddenly asked about rejoining the EU, and Lammy shut that down faster than a pub at last call. \"Unless public opinion shifts, this debate is… yeah.\" Then, out of nowhere, he mused about Trump’s possible return: \"Trump doesn’t like losing. I mean, he might actually keep funding Ukraine just to avoid looking weak?\" A pause. \"Or not. Who knows.\"  Somewhere in the background, a staffer’s phone buzzed incessantly—probably a Group Chat of Doom.  As the ICC deliberates, this case has become less about justice and more about whether international law can survive the dumpster fire of great-power politics. For Lammy, it’s also a preview of Labour’s foreign policy: principled, awkward, and guaranteed to piss someone off.  Oh, and fun fact: Lammy’s office has a framed photo of his cat, Mr. Whiskers, who—ironically—was born on April Fool’s Day. Make of that what you will.\n",
      "Итог обработки П9: **ICC Arrest Warrants for Israeli Leaders Spark Diplomatic Tensions as Labour Pledges Compliance**  *The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) pursuit of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials has intensified global diplomatic divisions, with the UK’s Labour Party signalling it would uphold any ICC rulings—a stance that has drawn sharp criticism from pro-Israel factions.*  During a recent CNN interview, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy affirmed Labour’s commitment to the ICC and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), stating that political leaders should not interfere in judicial processes. \"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy said. \"It is not for politicians to influence judicial decisions, whether domestically or internationally.\"  His remarks, though consistent with Labour’s broader support for multilateral institutions, have provoked backlash. Conservative MPs accused Lammy of legitimising what they described as a politically motivated case, with one critic dismissing the ICC’s actions as akin to a \"kangaroo court.\"  The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in late May that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza conflict. The charges include accusations of starvation tactics, targeting civilians, and, in Hamas’s case, hostage-related atrocities.  The move has placed the ICC at the centre of a geopolitical storm, testing the credibility of international justice mechanisms amid fierce opposition from powerful states. The Biden administration condemned the warrants as \"outrageous,\" reflecting Washington’s longstanding scepticism toward the court.  Lammy, however, insisted that a future Labour government would comply with ICC rulings, predicting similar adherence across Europe. His comments come as the court’s judges weigh the evidence, a process that could take months and further inflame political tensions.  The interview also touched on broader foreign policy questions, including the UK’s relationship with the EU and the potential implications of a second Trump presidency. Lammy dismissed speculation about rejoining the EU, citing unchanged public opinion, but speculated on how a re-elected Donald Trump might approach Ukraine aid—suggesting unpredictability in US foreign policy.  The ICC case has underscored the fragile state of international law, with major powers increasingly willing to disregard judicial rulings that clash with their geopolitical interests. For Labour, the controversy offers an early glimpse of its foreign policy approach: institutionally aligned but likely to provoke strong reactions from allies and adversaries alike.  As the legal and diplomatic battle unfolds, the case may prove a defining moment for the ICC—and for the credibility of global justice in an era of deepening geopolitical fractures.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The International Criminal Court's move toward issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders has exposed raw geopolitical fault lines. In a combative CNN interview, UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy found himself walking a diplomatic tightrope—pledging Labour's support for the ICC while facing immediate backlash from Israel's allies.  \"Look, we’ve always supported the ICC—that’s not new,\" Lammy told Fareed Zakaria, his tone shifting between defiance and weariness as the host pressed him. \"But politicians shouldn’t be second-guessing judicial decisions, full stop.\" The remark, though consistent with Labour’s platform, drew swift condemnation from pro-Israel groups already skeptical of the party’s stance on the conflict.  The legal landscape here is anything but clear-cut. Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for warrants against Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders hinges on contested interpretations of international law. Legal analysts note the starvation charges against Israeli officials rely on disputed assessments of Gaza’s humanitarian access, while Hamas’s alleged crimes against humanity stem partly from testimonies of freed hostages.  Washington’s reaction—Biden called the warrants \"outrageous\"—stands in stark contrast to Lammy’s insistence that Britain would comply as a Rome Statute signatory. \"Here in the UK, we’ll follow the court’s rulings, and frankly, Europe should too,\" he said, though diplomatic sources suggest several EU capitals harbor quiet reservations about wading into the Gaza legal morass.  The interview took sharper turns when Zakaria pivoted to other flashpoints. On rejoining the EU, Lammy didn’t mince words: \"Unless there’s some seismic shift in public opinion, that conversation’s over.\" His take on a potential Trump comeback raised eyebrows—suggesting the former president’s transactional instincts might unexpectedly work in Ukraine’s favor. \"Say what you will about Trump, but he hates losing,\" Lammy mused. \"I don’t see him abandoning Kyiv if it means handing Putin a win.\"  With ICC judges still reviewing evidence, the coming weeks could either bolster the court’s authority or expose its vulnerabilities. But Lammy’s principled stance faces an immediate reality check: as U.S. and European positions diverge, the real test may be whether international law survives the collision with realpolitik.\n",
      "Оценка статьи: Here are the three strongest indicators that the text was likely generated by an LLM, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overly Formal or Generic Quotes**  \n",
      "   - *Pattern*: The quotes attributed to David Lammy (\"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" \"It's not for politicians to interfere...\") sound polished and overly rehearsed, lacking the natural cadence or spontaneity of real political speech.  \n",
      "   - *Deviation*: Real interviews often include hesitations, informal phrasing, or rhetorical hedging, especially on sensitive topics.  \n",
      "   - *Suggestion*: Rewrite the quotes to reflect more authentic speech, e.g., *\"Look, we’ve always supported the ICC—that’s not new. But politicians shouldn’t be second-guessing judicial decisions, full stop.\"*  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Excessive Summary of Complex Issues**  \n",
      "   - *Pattern*: The paragraph detailing the ICC's charges (\"Charges against Israeli officials include starvation tactics...\") condenses legally nuanced accusations into overly smooth, digestible phrasing without attribution or contextual depth.  \n",
      "   - *Deviation*: Professional journalism would cite legal experts, court documents, or dissenting views to add credibility.  \n",
      "   - *Suggestion*: Add specificity, e.g., *\"Legal analysts note the ICC’s starvation charge hinges on contested interpretations of Gaza’s humanitarian access, while Hamas’s alleged crimes rely on testimonies from freed hostages.\"*  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Predictable Narrative Arcs**  \n",
      "   - *Pattern*: The conclusion (\"As the ICC weighs its next move...\") frames the story with a sweeping, almost cinematic reflection on \"litmus tests\" and \"diplomatic costs,\" which feels formulaic.  \n",
      "   - *Deviation*: Human-written analysis tends to be messier, with caveats or unresolved questions rather than tidy moral/thematic closure.  \n",
      "   - *Suggestion*: End with an open question or contradiction, e.g., *\"Yet with the U.S. and EU divided over the warrants, Lammy’s principled stance may collide with realpolitik—leaving the ICC’s authority hanging in the balance.\"*\n",
      "итоговая статья: The city council meeting last night devolved into chaos—again—as residents debated the proposed parking fee hike. Councilwoman Elena Rodriguez, absentmindedly shredding a Starbucks napkin into confetti, insisted the increase was \"necessary to fund, um, infrastructure upgrades and stuff.\"  A guy in the back row—wearing a *Dune* t-shirt with what looked like ketchup stains—shouted something about \"corporate greed,\" then immediately sat down and started texting. Meanwhile, Mayor Thompson, whose left eye twitched every time someone said \"taxation,\" tried to regain control. \"Look, folks, we’re just trying to—\"  *BANG.* Somebody dropped a binder.  \"Okay, *Jesus*,\" muttered the clerk, adjusting her cracked iPhone case.  Local business owner Dave Cheney, who once told me his dog’s birthday is the same as his ex-wife’s (\"awkward, right?\"), argued the fees would \"kill small businesses—or, well, maybe not *kill*, but like, definitely hurt?\" He then trailed off, staring at the ceiling as if the answer were written there.  Across the room, retiree Margaret Peabody—clutching a tote bag that said *I ♥ BINGO*—cut in: \"Back in my day, we didn’t *need* meters. We just—\"  \"Parked illegally?\" someone heckled.  The mayor sighed, rubbing his temples. Ain’t nobody got time for this level of petty.  By the end, the council voted 5-2 to approve the hike, though nobody seemed happy about it. Rodriguez, now folding her shredded napkin into a tiny origami swan, called it \"the least worst option.\"  Outside, a stray cat licked at a discarded donut. Democracy in action.\n"

      "Статья 74: **French expats in UK navigate dual elections with humor and grit**  Leeds was soggy last Sunday, but the queue outside the Novotel snaked on regardless—a damp but determined line of French expats waiting to cast their ballots in France’s snap parliamentary election. Among them was 19-year-old Léo Martin, a first-time voter who’d nearly skipped the trip until his aunt sent him a clip of Marine Le Pen grinning on the news. \"That got me moving,\" he said, shaking rain off his jacket.  For French citizens in Britain, this summer has become an exercise in bureaucratic gymnastics. Between the UK general election and France’s hastily called parliamentary vote—announced with just three weeks’ notice—many are wrestling with two sets of voting rules while juggling work, travel, and the occasional existential dread.  The logistical hurdles are hitting young voters hardest. Students scattering for summer internships or gap years find themselves caught between systems: France’s theoretically streamlined online voting, which often requires obscure ID numbers, and Britain’s stubbornly analog paperwork. \"I registered at my uni address, then took a job in Greece,\" said Matthieu Fournier, now staring down a postal vote form demanding wet-ink signatures. \"They might as well ask for a carrier pigeon.\"  France’s election authority, keen to mobilize voters against the far-right National Rally’s surge, has pushed online voting as a solution. But for many raised abroad, the digital route is a dead end. \"FranceConnect asked for a student ID I never had,\" said Sophie Lefèvre, 20, trying to vote from her grandmother’s house in Normandy. Others face geography-defying requirements, like engineering student Thomas Mercier, currently on a research ship off Newfoundland. His proxy vote needs notarization at a consulate—\"unless we detour to St. Pierre and Miquelon,\" he noted wryly.  Parents have stepped in as unlikely campaigners. \"First I tried reason, then guilt,\" said Paris-born Londoner Isabelle Laurent, who eventually secured her sons’ proxy forms by hinting Macron might revoke their croissant rights.  Despite the chaos, turnout hints at a stubborn engagement. Léo, now dripping inside the polling station, summed it up: \"French bureaucracy 2, democracy nil—but here we are.\"\n",
      "Статья 85: The rain in Leeds last Sunday didn’t deter the line of French citizens stretching outside the Novotel. They’d come to vote in France’s snap parliamentary election—some grumbling about the timing, others checking their phones for updates on Marine Le Pen’s National Rally. Léo Martin, 19, almost didn’t make the trip until his aunt forwarded a news clip of Le Pen’s latest speech. \"She just texted it with three angry-face emojis,\" he said, wiping water from his sleeves. \"I figured I should probably show up.\"  For France’s expats in Britain, this summer has meant navigating two elections back-to-back: the UK’s July 4 vote and France’s sudden parliamentary contest, called with barely three weeks’ notice. The overlap has created a tangle of paperwork, missed deadlines, and last-minute scrambles—particularly for younger voters whose summer plans collided with voting requirements.  Matthieu Fournier, a student who took a bartending job in Greece after finishing exams, discovered his UK-registered postal vote needed physical signatures mailed back to Leeds. \"The deadline’s tomorrow, and DHL just quoted me €50,\" he said over a crackling FaceTime call. France’s election authority has promoted online voting through FranceConnect, but the system often rejects those without specific French ID numbers. Sophie Lefèvre, 20, spent an hour trying to log in from her grandmother’s Normandy home before giving up. \"It kept asking for a student ID from a school I never attended,\" she said.  Some cases border on the absurd. Thomas Mercier, an engineering student on a month-long research expedition off Newfoundland’s coast, learned his proxy vote required notarization at a consulate—the nearest being a 36-hour detour to France’s tiny St. Pierre and Miquelon islands. \"The captain laughed when I asked,\" he said via WhatsApp.  Parents have become reluctant get-out-the-vote operatives. Isabelle Laurent, a Paris-born accountant in London, spent days convincing her university-age sons to arrange proxies. \"First I explained the stakes, then I may have implied Macron would cancel their healthcare,\" she admitted. \"Desperate times.\"  Yet despite the hurdles, turnout at Leeds’ polling station remained steady—a mix of exasperation and determination. Léo, finally inside and shaking rain from his hair, glanced at the ballot box. \"Typical French logic,\" he muttered. \"Make it impossible, then act surprised when people complain.\" Then he voted anyway.\n",
      "Статья 53: Are elections like buses?

      "Статья 66: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has reignited debate over Liz Truss's economic policies after defending her approach in leaked remarks from a private Conservative gathering at Oxford University last month.  In audio obtained by *The Guardian*, Hunt praised Truss's ambition to lower taxes and reduce regulation, while acknowledging the fallout from her 2022 mini-budget. \"She owned her mistakes with grace,\" he said. \"The policies weren’t wrong—it was the execution.\"  The September 2022 mini-budget, which included £45 billion in unfunded tax cuts, triggered market turmoil, sending the pound to record lows and forcing emergency intervention by the Bank of England. Truss and then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng were swiftly replaced by Hunt and Rishi Sunak, who reversed most of the measures.  Despite the backlash, Hunt has cautiously aligned himself with Truss's long-term goals, emphasizing a slower, more fiscally disciplined approach. \"I’m cutting taxes too,\" he told students, \"but gradually—proving at each step we can control borrowing.\"  Labour has seized on the remarks, accusing the government of failing to learn from past mistakes. \"The Tories still want reckless tax cuts without a credible plan to pay for them,\" said Shadow Treasury Minister Darren Jones. The party has also challenged Hunt’s claim that recent tax reductions were funded by welfare savings, arguing the money was already allocated in previous budgets.  Sunak, who publicly opposed Truss’s strategy, now faces renewed scrutiny over internal Conservative divisions. Hunt’s comments follow recent tensions over HS2, where the Chancellor appeared to question the Prime Minister’s decision to scrap the rail project’s northern leg.  Economists remain divided on the legacy of Trussonomics. \"The vision for growth wasn’t flawed, but the lack of market credibility was disastrous,\" said Dr. Sarah Hall of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. Others, however, see contradictions in Hunt’s stance. \"He had to dismantle her policies to stabilize the economy—now he’s endorsing them again,\" a Treasury source noted.  With an election approaching, Hunt’s balancing act—supporting Truss’s ideals while distancing himself from their consequences—may prove a difficult sell to voters still dealing with the aftermath of the 2022 crisis.\n",
      "Статья 58: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's private praise for Liz Truss's economic vision has thrown gasoline on simmering Conservative divisions—and given Labour fresh ammunition just months before an expected election. In leaked audio from a Tory gathering at Oxford University, obtained by *The Guardian*, Hunt defended Truss's tax-cutting ambitions while delicately sidestepping the financial carnage they unleashed. \"She owned her mistakes with grace,\" Hunt told students. \"The policies weren’t wrong—it was the execution.\"  The remark lands like a grenade in Westminster. When Truss and then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled £45 billion in unfunded tax cuts in September 2022, the pound nosedived, mortgage rates spiraled, and the Bank of England staged an emergency intervention—all within ten chaotic days. Now Hunt, the man brought in to clean up the mess, is reviving the very rhetoric that torched Tory credibility. His careful qualification—\"I’m cutting taxes too, but gradually\"—does little to mask the political gamble.  Labour’s Darren Jones pounced immediately. \"This proves the Tories haven’t learned a damn thing,\" the Shadow Treasury Minister fired off, branding Hunt’s recent tax reductions as \"smoke-and-mirrors accounting.\" The opposition claims the Chancellor’s supposed welfare savings were already baked into earlier budgets—a charge that lands as Prime Minister Sunak battles rebellions over HS2 cuts and sinking poll numbers.  Economists are equally skeptical of Hunt’s tightrope walk. \"Truss’s growth vision wasn’t inherently flawed, but treating markets like lab rats was suicidal,\" said Dr. Sarah Hall, a political economist who advised Whitehall during the crisis. A Treasury insider put it more bluntly: \"He spent a year dismantling her policies to save the economy. Now he’s handing matches back to the arsonist.\"  For voters still nursing 2022’s financial hangover—higher mortgages, pricier groceries—Hunt’s attempt to rehabilitate Trussonomics risks sounding like a bad punchline. With the Conservatives trailing by double digits, the Chancellor’s Oxford musings may haunt him all the way to the ballot box.\n",
      "Статья 98: Jeremy Hunt said Liz Truss’s economic ambitions were a “good thing to aim for” and her disastrous mini-budget hadn’t left an impact on the economy, according to two leaked recordings obtained by the Guardian. The chancellor was recorded at a meeting of students when he said he was “trying to basically achieve some of the same things” as the former prime minister, but that he was doing it “more gradually”. In a sign of desperation the chancellor, who is fighting to hold on to his Surrey seat, separately told a local hustings event: “I speak tonight as Jeremy Hunt”, adding: “I’m not always going to take the government line.” Hunt praised Truss for “accepting the mistakes she’d made with good grace” and repeatedly refused to accept her plans had left a long-term impact on the economy. When pressed on whether he thought the country was currently battling negative effects, he said: “No I don’t think it’s had an effect. I don’t think it’s the main cause.” Labour said the remarks showed that the Conservatives had an “addiction to dangerous Trussonomics”. Hunt took over as chancellor after Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng in an attempt to save her premiership following the mini-budget, which proposed a £45bn package of tax cuts, including the abolition of the top (45p) rate of income tax. He reversed a number of the key measures in the budget in order to stabilise the markets, leading to him being described as the country’s de facto prime minister, and Truss was forced out 10 days later on 20 October 2022. His refusal to acknowledge the impact Truss’s mini-budget made is in stark contrast to comments from Rishi Sunak. The prime minister has said that “two years ago I wasn’t afraid to repeatedly warn about what her economic policies would lead to”. The Conservative manifesto offers another 2p off national insurance contributions (NICs), a gradual phasing out of self-employed NICs, a cut to stamp duty, higher thresholds for child benefit and a tax break for pensioners. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “The Tories can pretend otherwise but this is who they are. When the door is closed and the cameras are off it all comes out – the same addiction to dangerous Trussonomics. “Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget and unfunded tax cuts unleashed misery on millions by sending mortgage rates soaring. Now the chancellor admits he is trying to implement these policies by stealth, without the British public realising.” Speaking at a meeting of the Oxford University Conservatives on 9 May, Hunt was asked about his own pledges on low tax made in his leadership campaign and Truss’s claims to have been blocked by the civil service and other economic institutions, and whether he faced “the same kind of opposition”. In a recording of the exchange, Hunt can be heard to say, to some laughter, that Truss “appointed me as chancellor you know, I want to be respectful of that fact. But I think the issue with most of the policies wasn’t that they weren’t a good thing to aim for”. He said Truss “didn’t explain in that mini-budget how she was to fund [her tax cuts]. And so markets thought that we were just basically going to fund all these tax cuts by massively increasing borrowing. And they took fright.” The chancellor said he hoped to “basically achieve some of the same things that she wanted to achieve. But I’m doing it more gradually because I’m demonstrating at every stage that this is consistent with keeping borrowing under control. So, it’s taking longer to get there, but I think it’s obviously in a way we can actually deliver it.” The recordings emerged as the chancellor came under fire for comments in a newsletter to constituents in which he wrote that tax cuts in the Conservative manifesto would be funded by savings from “an enormous back-to-work programme (which I announced in the autumn statement last year)”. Labour said it showed the Conservatives were double-counting welfare cuts in order to fund tax cuts. The party intends to use this week’s campaigning to put the spotlight on the Conservatives’ economic record. During a visit to Southampton on Monday, Keir Starmer accused Hunt of making “completely unfunded” promises. He said: “What has emerged this morning is truly extraordinary because what you’ve got is no less than the chancellor admitting that the money that they were pretending was available in their manifesto for their desperate policies is in fact money that’s already been accounted for. “So that means you’ve got a manifesto from the Tories which isn’t worth the paper on which it is written because it is completely unfunded. It is extraordinary – the fact that it has come from the chancellor I think makes it even more extraordinary. The money isn’t there, that’s the major problem.” The Conservatives said the savings they intended to use to fund tax cuts would come from new policies. “The measures to achieve £12bn in welfare savings had not been announced at the time of the last OBR forecast so the entire premise of his [Starmer’s] latest press conference is redundant,” a spokesperson said. Hunt, whose Godalming and Ash constituency is a target seat for the Liberal Democrats, also seemed to suggest at the hustings that HS2 shouldn’t have been cancelled. Responding to a local Tory member who said scrapping HS2 “sends out the wrong signal”, Hunt said: “I think when parliament has decided democratically we’re going to do these things and we pass an act of parliament we need to find a way of making them happen.” A Conservative spokesperson said: “This is nonsense and takes the Chancellor’s words out of context entirely. “We want to lower the tax burden and boost growth, and that’s exactly what we have done with our fully-funded tax cuts and inflation returning to normal levels”.\n",

An earlier version said that, among the sweeping tax cuts proposed in Kwasi Kwarteng’s September 2022 budget was a “cut to the top rate of income tax”; in fact, the plan was to abolish the top (45p) rate. This has been corrected.\n",

      "Статья 80: Nigel Farage's dramatic return to frontline politics has injected fresh uncertainty into Britain's already volatile general election campaign. The Reform UK leader, who initially ruled out standing as a candidate, reversed course last week to contest the Essex seat of Clacton - a decision that threatens to further erode Conservative support.  Polling suggests Farage's party has doubled its national share to 11% since his announcement, with Reform UK now drawing significant support in traditional Tory strongholds. Electoral analysts warn this could prove catastrophic for Rishi Sunak's Conservatives, who already trail Labour by more than 20 points in most surveys. \"Farage's return complicates an already dire situation for the Tories,\" said Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University. \"Even modest Reform gains could cost dozens of Conservative seats.\"  The veteran campaigner wasted no time reigniting his signature immigration rhetoric, though some claims faced immediate scrutiny. Migration experts challenged his assertion about \"permanent settlement\" patterns, with Dr. Madeleine Sumption of Oxford's Migration Observatory noting: \"Net migration figures fluctuate considerably, and policy changes can significantly impact these trends.\"  Farage's inflammatory comments about British Muslim communities also drew sharp criticism. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain described the remarks as \"selective and misleading,\" citing government data showing most British Muslims report positive views of life in the UK. In Clacton, local imam Yusuf Patel questioned Farage's understanding of the constituency's long-established Muslim community.  Yet the message resonates with some voters. \"People here feel ignored by the main parties,\" said Derek Hobbs, a construction worker in Clacton, where Reform UK now polls at 32%. Such sentiment reflects broader discontent that could split the right-wing vote in key constituencies.  While Farage has never won a parliamentary seat despite seven attempts, his political influence is undeniable. The Brexit campaign he championed in 2016 reshaped British politics, and analysts suggest his current intervention could have similarly far-reaching consequences. However, Britain's electoral system presents significant hurdles - in Clacton, Farage must overturn a Conservative majority of nearly 25,000 votes.  For Prime Minister Sunak, the timing presents yet another challenge as he struggles to shore up Conservative support. \"Every percentage point lost to Reform makes our path more difficult,\" admitted one Tory strategist speaking anonymously. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer has largely avoided direct engagement with Farage, focusing instead on policy proposals.  As the campaign enters its final weeks, Farage's impact remains unpredictable. Whether or not he wins in Clacton, his presence ensures this election will be anything but conventional.\n",
      "Статья 76: Nigel Farage's eleventh-hour decision to stand in Clacton has sent shockwaves through Westminster, upending Rishi Sunak's already precarious election strategy. The Reform UK leader's abrupt U-turn—announced with characteristic showmanship at a seaside rally last Monday—has since seen his party's polling surge to 11% nationally, according to a YouGov snap survey. Conservative campaign headquarters now privately fears losing dozens of marginals where even modest Reform gains could prove decisive.  \"Sunak's team were already staring into the abyss,\" says Queen Mary University's Tim Bale, crunching the numbers. \"Now they're watching Farage peel away their core vote in exactly the constituencies they can least afford to lose.\"  True to form, Farage wasted no time reigniting culture war battles. His claim that \"migrant settlement patterns have become permanent\" was swiftly debunked by Oxford migration scholars, with Dr. Madeleine Sumption countering: \"Net migration figures are highly responsive to policy changes—just look at the 2022 drop after Ukraine visa schemes were introduced.\" The backlash intensified when Farage targeted British Muslim communities, prompting Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain to brand his comments \"dangerously selective cherry-picking of statistics.\"  Yet in Clacton's working-class estates, such rhetoric finds fertile ground. \"We've had enough of being treated like fools by Westminster,\" says Derek Hobbs, a scaffolder leaning on his van outside a Greggs bakery. Reform now commands 32% local support here—though Farage must overturn a 25,000-vote Tory majority in a seat that last elected a non-Conservative MP in 1997.  The parallels with 2016 loom large. Just as Farage's Brexit campaign reshaped political realities eight years ago, his return has forced both main parties into defensive maneuvers. Labour strategists confirm Starmer has been briefed to avoid direct confrontation (\"Don't make him the story,\" reads one internal memo), while panicked Tory candidates in coastal seats report doorstep encounters where lifelong Conservatives now declare they're \"giving Farage a chance.\"  At a seafront Wetherspoons in Clacton, retired nurse Margaret Ellis captures the mood: \"They all say he can't win. They said that about Brexit too.\" Whether this proves another political earthquake or a final Farage sideshow may hinge on how many voters share her defiance.\n",
      "Статья 106: “Thus far, it is the dullest, most boring election campaign we have ever seen in our lives. And it’s funny because the more the two big party leaders tried to be different, the more they actually sound the same,” declared the British anti-immigration populist Nigel Farage as he announced on Monday his intention to stand in the UK’s general election. The 60-year-old anti-EU party leader has failed seven times to be elected to Britain’s Westminster parliament but his entry into the fray – only a week after he insisted he would not stand so he could help campaign for Donald Trump in the US – has dominated a so far lacklustre election campaign at the start of its second full week. It is not certain Farage will be elected this time either, but the chief interest in his decision to return to lead Reform, his political vehicle, is the impact it will have on Britain’s ruling but faltering Conservatives. Under the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, they already appear to be heading for a heavy defeat at the hands of the left-leaning Labour opposition, led by Keir Starmer, when the election takes place on 4 July. At a 40-minute press conference at the Glaziers Hall, a prestigious London venue close to the River Thames, Farage pursued an anti-establishment argument. He claimed Britain faced an “immigration election” – though he exaggerated the numbers coming in to settle, claiming that all those who entered the UK to work or study in the past year intended to remain permanently. A week earlier, more controversially, Farage in a television interview had declared a “growing number” of young Muslims in the UK do not subscribe to an undefined set of British values. The conclusion was based on a single poll in April commissioned by a rightwing thinktank that highlighted that a quarter of Muslims surveyed believed Hamas had committed murder and rape in its deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. Other polls of British Muslims, taken earlier this year and not referenced by Farage, report that 86% of respondents believe Britain is a good place to live when it comes to people having the chance to thrive. In Britain, the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, but under Sunak, they trail Labour by 20 percentage points according to an average of the opinion polls. Translating that accurately into an election result is difficult, but one analysis, released on Monday an hour after Farage’s launch event by the researchers YouGov, suggests the rightwing party would win only 140 out of 650 parliamentary seats – its worst result since 1906. And this does not take into account Farage’s personal entry into the election campaign. Despite his past electoral failures, Farage, ironically a former member of the European parliament, remains one of the UK’s best-known and polarising politicians, who came to the fore in the early 2010s. By then he was a persistent campaigner for Britain leaving the European Union – resulting, in the now popular shorthand, in Brexit. While Trump was able to take over the Republicans in the US, Farage’s principal achievement was to exercise pressure on the Conservative party from outside. He helped force the former prime minister David Cameron to call a referendum on the UK’s EU membership, in the belief he would win it. The Conservatives split over the issue and Cameron misjudged the public mood. Britain narrowly voted out in the summer of 2016, Cameron resigned, and the result was hailed by Trump as “a great victory” a few months before he won the US presidency. After the Brexit vote, Farage languished, without a guiding cause. He became a presenter on the rightwing news channel GB News in 2021, at that time a media novelty in the UK, and periodically tried to ignite public concerns about migration into the UK via “small boats” across the Channel from France. But it was clear from his remarks over the past couple of days that he sees in the current election situation an opportunity to be near the centre of attention. “Starmer has won this election,” Farage declared on Monday, as he suggested his Reform party, now polling about 11%, could overtake Sunak’s party on 22%. “I genuinely believe we can get more votes in this election than the Conservative party. They are on the verge of total collapse,” he said, repeatedly accusing the party of failing to reduce immigration to the UK. In other interviews on Tuesday he added that he could stage a reverse takeover of the Conservatives at some unspecified point in the years ahead. The rhetoric is calibrated to attract publicity and rightwing votes, but the reality is not helped by Britain’s electoral system, based entirely on small single-member constituencies, which favours large well-established parties. Farage’s plan is to run in Clacton, a modest seaside town in Essex, 55 miles north-east of London, one of the few places that has previously elected a member of parliament for one of his predecessor anti-EU parties. But the Conservative majority he has to overturn is a hefty 24,702. He got off to a shaky start on Tuesday when what appeared to be a banana milkshake was thrown over him on his first day of campaigning as he left a pub in the town. Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, argues Farage’s move is all about last-minute timing. “Britons already knew Farage was the leader behind the scenes – the question is what is the short-term impact from the publicity boost from his announcement. Most likely it will prevent the Conservatives being able to take his votes, but there is a non-zero chance that if Sunak’s party continues to do badly, there could be a tipping point and Farage gets ahead.”\n",

He helped force the former prime minister David Cameron to call a referendum on the UK’s EU membership, in the belief he would win it. The Conservatives split over the issue and Cameron misjudged the public mood. Britain narrowly voted out in the summer of 2016, Cameron resigned, and the result was hailed by Trump as “a great victory” a few months before he won the US presidency. After the Brexit vote, Farage languished, without a guiding cause. He became a presenter on the rightwing news channel GB News in 2021, at that time a media novelty in the UK, and periodically tried to ignite public concerns about migration into the UK via “small boats” across the Channel from France. But it was clear from his remarks over the past couple of days that he sees in the current election situation an opportunity to be near the centre of attention. “Starmer has won this election,” Farage declared on Monday, as he suggested his Reform party, now polling about 11%, could overtake Sunak’s party on 22%. “I genuinely believe we can get more votes in this election than the Conservative party. They are on the verge of total collapse,” he said, repeatedly accusing the party of failing to reduce immigration to the UK. In other interviews on Tuesday he added that he could stage a reverse takeover of the Conservatives at some unspecified point in the years ahead. The rhetoric is calibrated to attract publicity and rightwing votes, but the reality is not helped by Britain’s electoral system, based entirely on small single-member constituencies, which favours large well-established parties. Farage’s plan is to run in Clacton, a modest seaside town in Essex, 55 miles north-east of London, one of the few places that has previously elected a member of parliament for one of his predecessor anti-EU parties. But the Conservative majority he has to overturn is a hefty 24,702. He got off to a shaky start on Tuesday when what appeared to be a banana milkshake was thrown over him on his first day of campaigning as he left a pub in the town. Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, argues Farage’s move is all about last-minute timing. “Britons already knew Farage was the leader behind the scenes – the question is what is the short-term impact from the publicity boost from his announcement. “Most likely it will prevent the Conservatives being able to take his votes, but there is a non-zero chance that if Sunak’s party continues to do badly, there could be a tipping point and Farage gets ahead.”\n",
