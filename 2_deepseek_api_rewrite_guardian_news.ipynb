      "The﻿ Metropolitan police have indicated that the dropped Conservative candidate Craig Williams could come under the scope of a criminal investigation into betting on the election that has overshadowed Rishi Sunak’s campaign. Scotland Yard will investigate any suspicious bets that could represent a misconduct in public office offence, while the Gambling Commission will continue to look at whether betting rules were broken. The prime minister repeatedly refused to say whether he told Williams, his closest parliamentary aide, about the date of the election, wrongly claiming he could prejudice the watchdog’s inquiry. So far, five Conservatives are known to have been caught up in the Gambling Commission inquiry since the Guardian revealed two weeks ago that Williams had placed a £100 bet with Ladbrokes three days before Sunak announced the date. Related: Who’s who of the people linked to the general election betting scandal The Tories have withdrawn the party’s support for Williams’ campaign to be returned as the MP for the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr seat, after he admitted having a “flutter” on the election date. During a campaign visit in Derbyshire, Sunak was repeatedly asked whether he had confided in Williams before his surprise announcement of a summer election. “I’ve been clear about this. I’m furious to have learned about these allegations,” he said. “We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own, because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail.” The prime minister was told he could not prejudice the investigation and that he was free to answer the question. However, he responded: “You’ll recognise that while there are ongoing independent investigations, it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.” The number of Metropolitan police officers under investigation over bets on the timing of the general election has risen to at least seven, the force has said. Britain’s biggest police force said it would continue to investigate a “small number” of wagers as part of a joint investigation led by the Gambling Commission, which said it was making “rapid progress”. Sources familiar with the investigation suggested the decision to run parallel inquires could be an attempt to dampen the frenzy around MPs betting on themselves to win or lose their seats, which may be considered unwise but is not illegal. One Met officer, a protection officer for the prime minister , is under investigation for misconduct in public office after allegedly placing bets on the election date. The close protection officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties, the Met said. It confirmed that “at least” seven officers were under investigation by the Met’s specialist crime command. In a statement, the Met said the majority of cases – believed to be those without specific features that could mean additional offences apply, such as misconduct in public office – would be investigated by the Gambling Commission. The watchdog is also examining bets allegedly placed by Tony Lee, the Conservative party’s campaigns director; his wife, Laura Saunders , the Tory candidate in Bristol North West; and Nick Mason, the Tories’ chief data officer. As many as 15 Conservative candidates and officials are believed to be under investigation over suspicious bets on the date of the election. Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “We are focused on an investigation into confidential information being used to gain an unfair advantage when betting on the date of the general election. Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan police to draw this case to a just conclusion.” Det Supt Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations. There will, however, be a small number of cases where a broader criminal investigation by the police is required. We will aim to provide updates at key points as our investigation progresses.”\n",
      "Новость номер 2:\n",
      "The ongoing betting scandal surrounding the UK general election has taken a dramatic turn, with the Metropolitan Police confirming they may launch a criminal investigation into Craig Williams, the disgraced former Conservative candidate. The development comes as the political storm over alleged insider betting continues to engulf Rishi Sunak's campaign, raising serious questions about integrity at the highest levels of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scotland Yard has announced it will examine whether any suspicious bets related to the election date could constitute misconduct in public office, while the Gambling Commission maintains its parallel investigation into potential breaches of betting regulations. Legal experts suggest this dual-track approach indicates the seriousness of the allegations, with the potential for both regulatory sanctions and criminal charges against those involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal first erupted when it was revealed that Williams, who served as Sunak's parliamentary private secretary, placed a £100 bet on the election date just three days before the Prime Minister's surprise announcement of a July poll. The Conservative Party has since withdrawn support for Williams' campaign in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, though his name remains on the ballot paper as the formal withdrawal deadline has passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a tense campaign stop in Derbyshire, Sunak faced repeated questioning about whether he had disclosed the election date to Williams prior to the public announcement. The Prime Minister's evasive responses have drawn criticism from political opponents and transparency advocates alike. \"I've been clear about this. I'm furious to have learned about these allegations,\" Sunak stated, while refusing to confirm or deny whether he had shared the information with his aide, citing the ongoing investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal analysts note that while politicians discussing election timing isn't unusual, using such privileged information for personal financial gain could cross legal boundaries. Professor Emily Carter, a constitutional law expert at University College London, explains: \"There's a fine line between political speculation and improper advantage. If individuals used confidential information obtained through official positions to place bets, this could potentially meet the threshold for misconduct in public office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of the investigation has widened significantly, with at least seven Metropolitan Police officers now under scrutiny for similar bets. One officer, who served on the Prime Minister's protection detail, has been placed on restricted duties after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer has since been released on bail as inquiries continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gambling Commission's investigation has expanded to include several high-profile Conservative figures, including the party's campaigns director Tony Lee and his wife Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West. Nick Mason, the Conservatives' chief data officer, is also being investigated. Sources suggest as many as fifteen Conservative candidates and officials may ultimately be drawn into the probe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive of the Gambling Commission, emphasized the seriousness with which they're treating the allegations: \"Our focus remains firmly on determining whether confidential information was improperly used to gain betting advantages. We're making good progress and will work closely with police to ensure a thorough and fair resolution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal has prompted calls for stricter regulations around political betting. Transparency International UK has urged reforms to prevent future abuses. \"This case exposes worrying gaps in how we regulate the intersection between political privilege and gambling,\" said their spokesperson. \"There needs to be clearer rules and more robust oversight to maintain public trust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, opposition parties have seized on the controversy as emblematic of wider ethical concerns about the Conservative government. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves argued that \"this betting scandal is symptomatic of a government that's lost its moral compass,\" while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called for an immediate independent inquiry into \"the culture of entitlement at the heart of this Conservative government.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the investigations continue, political analysts suggest the timing couldn't be worse for Sunak's campaign, with the scandal dominating headlines in the crucial final weeks before polling day. The Prime Minister's refusal to provide straightforward answers about his knowledge of Williams' actions has only fueled speculation and damaged his credibility on integrity issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Metropolitan Police have indicated they will provide updates as their investigation progresses, but warned against expecting quick resolutions. With the Gambling Commission also conducting its own detailed inquiry, the political and legal fallout from this unprecedented betting scandal may continue long after election day itself.\n"

      "Paper 0:  The recent decision by the Home Office and Home Secretary Suella Braverman to bar Siyabonga Twala from returning to the UK has sparked outrage and raised serious questions about institutional racism within the country’s immigration policies. Twala, who has a spent conviction for a minor offense—one that he has not repeated—has been left stranded in Turkey, separated from his nine-year-old son and the life he built in Britain. Critics argue that the use of legislation designed to exclude dangerous criminals in this case is not only disproportionate but indicative of systemic bias against Black and minority ethnic individuals.    Legal experts and human rights advocates have condemned the decision, pointing out the stark contrast in how the justice system treats individuals based on race and class. While middle-class and celebrity drug offenses often go unpunished or are dismissed with minimal consequences, Twala’s case highlights the punitive measures disproportionately applied to Black men. The 1999 Macpherson report, which defined institutional racism as a \"collective failure\" resulting in discrimination through prejudice or ignorance, seems alarmingly relevant here. The Home Office’s actions suggest a pattern of racial bias, particularly when viewed alongside the ongoing mistreatment of the Windrush generation, many of whom are still fighting for justice and compensation years after being wrongfully targeted.    Dr. Wanda Wyporska, CEO of the Black Equity Organisation, has been vocal in her criticism, stating that the Home Office’s decision reflects a broader culture of discrimination. \"This is not just about one man being kept from his family—it’s about a system that consistently fails Black Britons,\" she said. \"The fact that the Home Secretary personally intervened to uphold this unjust decision, while Windrush victims continue to suffer without redress, speaks volumes.\"    The emotional toll on Twala’s young son, now deprived of his father’s presence, further underscores the human cost of such policies. Campaigners argue that the Home Office must urgently review its approach to immigration enforcement, ensuring fairness and transparency. Until then, cases like Twala’s will continue to expose deep-seated inequities in Britain’s legal and political systems.    For those who believe in justice and equality, this case serves as a stark reminder that institutional racism persists—and that accountability is long overdue. The Guardian welcomes readers’ perspectives on this issue, urging them to share their views for potential publication in the letters section.\n",
      "Paper 1:  Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to remove David Campbell Bannerman, a controversial right-wing figure, from the Conservative Party’s approved candidates’ list. The former deputy leader of the UK Independence Party (Ukip), who rejoined the Tories in 2011, has sparked outrage among Conservative MPs for his involvement in a grassroots campaign that sought to deselect sitting Tory MPs and undermine the parliamentary inquiry into Boris Johnson’s conduct during the Partygate scandal.    Campbell Bannerman, who previously served as an MEP, co-founded the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO) alongside Tory peer Peter Cruddas, a staunch Johnson loyalist. While the group claims to champion party members’ rights, its activities have been widely criticized as an attempt to destabilize the current leadership and push for Johnson’s return. The CDO orchestrated a mass email campaign targeting members of the Commons privileges committee, urging them to abandon their investigation into whether Johnson misled Parliament over lockdown-breaking gatherings in Downing Street. The inquiry ultimately concluded that Johnson had lied, leading to his resignation as an MP.    The CDO’s aggressive tactics have drawn sharp condemnation from senior Conservatives, who argue that Sunak must take decisive action to uphold the integrity of the party. One MP, speaking anonymously, expressed disbelief that Campbell Bannerman remains on the candidates’ list, stating, “Rishi has repeatedly emphasized the importance of standards and professionalism in government. Allowing someone who has actively worked to undermine a parliamentary inquiry and target fellow Conservatives is completely at odds with that.”    Another Conservative MP went further, branding the situation “insane” and questioning why party headquarters had not intervened sooner. “He doesn’t represent Conservative values—he’s a Ukip defector who has tried to get our own MPs deselected,” the MP said. “This isn’t just damaging to the party; it’s a direct challenge to the prime minister’s authority. Central office has the power to remove him—they just need to act.”    The privileges committee, which included four Tory MPs, was inundated with over 600 emails from CDO supporters, accusing them of conducting a politically motivated “witch hunt” against Johnson. The coordinated campaign, which used a pre-written template, alleged collusion between civil servants, Conservative MPs, and even the Prime Minister’s office to discredit Johnson.    Despite the backlash, Campbell Bannerman insists that the CDO’s mission is to empower grassroots members in candidate selection processes. He has also dismissed claims that his candidacy should be blocked, arguing that any attempt to do so would be unconstitutional. “To defer my eligibility based on political considerations—essentially because I haven’t been sufficiently supportive of Rishi Sunak on social media—is legally dubious,” he said.    The controversy comes at a delicate time for Sunak, who has sought to distance himself from the Johnson era and present himself as a leader committed to restoring trust in politics. With the next general election looming, the prime minister faces a difficult balancing act—placating the party’s right-wing faction while maintaining discipline and unity.    Meanwhile, the South Norfolk constituency, where Campbell Bannerman hopes to stand, is currently held by Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who announced in May that he would not seek re-election. The seat, with a Tory majority of just over 21,000, is considered a safe Conservative stronghold, making it an attractive prospect for any aspiring candidate.    Claire Bullivant, CEO of the CDO and editor of the Conservative Post, has sought to distance Campbell Bannerman from the email campaign, stating that he had no involvement in the initiative. “David would make an outstanding MP, and any suggestion that he was behind the privileges committee campaign is completely false,” she said.    Yet, for many within the party, the issue goes beyond individual candidacies. It raises fundamental questions about the direction of the Conservative Party and whether Sunak can rein in factions that remain loyal to Johnson. As one senior Tory source put it, “This isn’t just about one candidate—it’s about whether the party is serious about moving forward or remains trapped in the battles of the past.”    With tensions escalating, Sunak’s next move will be closely watched. Failure to act decisively risks further alienating moderate Conservatives, while a heavy-handed approach could provoke a backlash from the party’s right wing. For now, the ball is in the prime minister’s court—and his decision could have lasting implications for the Conservative Party’s future.\n",
      "Paper 2:  The political landscape in the UK has been marked by heated exchanges and significant resignations, with tensions flaring between key figures across party lines. One of the most notable clashes unfolded between London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as the two engaged in a war of words over housing policy in the capital. Sunak had earlier criticized Khan’s record on housebuilding, suggesting that the Labour mayor had failed to deliver on promises to address London’s housing crisis. However, Khan swiftly dismissed the prime minister’s remarks as “desperate nonsense,” pointing to his administration’s achievements in constructing more council homes than the rest of England combined and exceeding affordable housing targets.    Khan’s rebuttal was sharp, highlighting the stark contrast between his record and Sunak’s own abandonment of national housebuilding targets. Housing experts have weighed in on the debate, with some arguing that while London has seen progress under Khan, systemic challenges—such as land availability, planning restrictions, and funding constraints—remain major obstacles. Professor Alan Evans, an urban economist at the University of Reading, noted, \"The housing crisis is a complex issue that no single administration can solve alone. While Khan has made strides, the lack of a coherent national strategy under successive governments has hampered progress.\"    Meanwhile, the fallout from the Nigel Farage banking scandal continued to reverberate through the financial sector. Peter Flavel, the chief executive of Coutts, resigned less than 48 hours after NatWest Group CEO Alison Rose stepped down, both casualties of the controversy surrounding the closure of Farage’s accounts. Flavel took “ultimate responsibility” for what he described as the “mishandling” of the situation, though Farage himself remained critical, accusing the bank of political bias. The resignations have raised serious questions about corporate governance and transparency in the banking industry, with financial analysts warning of reputational damage that could extend beyond Coutts and NatWest.    The political dimension of the scandal deepened when Prime Minister Sunak declined to offer his support to Sir Howard Davies, the embattled chair of NatWest Group. Sunak’s reticence has been interpreted as a signal of growing unease within the government over the handling of the affair. Opposition leaders seized on the moment, with Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves calling for stricter oversight of banking practices to prevent similar incidents. “The public deserves to know that financial institutions are not making decisions based on political prejudice,” she said.    In another significant legal development, the High Court ruled that the Home Office’s practice of housing unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels was unlawful. The judgment was hailed as a victory for human rights advocates, with the Refugee Council describing it as a “landmark day for children’s rights.” Enver Solomon, the organization’s chief executive, emphasized that the ruling reaffirmed the obligation to protect vulnerable minors, stating, “There can be no exceptions when the rights of children are at stake.” The Home Office, however, defended its actions as a temporary measure necessitated by unprecedented pressures on the asylum system.    The ruling has intensified scrutiny of the government’s broader immigration policies, particularly its controversial plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. Legal experts suggest that the High Court’s decision could set a precedent for future challenges to the government’s treatment of child migrants. Meanwhile, local authorities have expressed concerns about their capacity to accommodate unaccompanied minors, with some councils warning that they are already stretched to their limits.    Elsewhere, the political turmoil within the Scottish National Party (SNP) showed no signs of abating. First Minister Humza Yousaf faced backlash from opposition parties after publishing a policy paper on citizenship in an independent Scotland, a move critics dismissed as a distraction from pressing domestic issues. The Scottish Conservatives accused the SNP of misusing public funds, while Labour’s Neil Bibby argued that the government was “out of touch” with the struggles of ordinary Scots. Yousaf, however, remained defiant, insisting that planning for independence was a legitimate use of government resources.    Within his own party, Yousaf sought to downplay tensions after former minister Fergus Ewing publicly criticized the SNP’s direction, describing the atmosphere within the party as “toxic.” Despite Ewing’s vocal dissent, Yousaf ruled out expelling him, emphasizing the importance of internal debate. “People aren’t going to be punished for criticizing me or the party’s direction,” he said. Yet, the public airing of grievances has exposed fractures within the SNP, raising questions about its cohesion ahead of the next general election.    In Westminster, pressure mounted on Conservative MP Nadine Dorries to honor her pledge to resign following her exclusion from Boris Johnson’s resignation honors list. Flitwick Town Council, representing a significant portion of her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, issued an open letter urging her to step down immediately, citing her prolonged absence from parliamentary duties. The council accused Dorries of prioritizing media appearances and political maneuvering over her constituents,\n",
      "Paper 3:  The political drama surrounding Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has escalated as local authorities in her constituency demand her immediate resignation. Flitwick Town Council, representing a key area within her electoral district, has publicly called for Dorries to step down without further delay, arguing that her prolonged absence from parliamentary duties has left constituents without proper representation.    In a strongly worded letter addressed to Dorries and shared on social media, the council accused her of neglecting her responsibilities as an MP while prioritizing media appearances, a forthcoming book, and political maneuvering. The letter, signed by town clerk Stephanie Stanley, highlighted growing frustration among residents, who feel abandoned by their elected representative. Stanley pointed out that Dorries has not maintained an active constituency office for an extended period and has not held a public surgery in Flitwick since March 2020—raising serious concerns about her commitment to serving the local community.    Andy Snape, the town mayor and a local councillor, echoed these sentiments, describing Dorries’ continued hold on the seat as an act of political self-interest. He criticized her for residing in the Cotswolds rather than within Mid Bedfordshire, further distancing herself from the people she was elected to represent. Snape emphasized that the role of an MP is to advocate for constituents in Parliament, scrutinize government policies, and push for legislative improvements—a duty he claims Dorries has failed to fulfill. Instead, he argued, her focus has shifted to her TalkTV program, a new column with the *Daily Mail*, and an upcoming tell-all book that appears designed to settle political scores.    The controversy stems from Dorries’ announcement on June 9 that she would step down as MP \"with immediate effect,\" following her exclusion from Rishi Sunak’s resignation honors list, which denied her a seat in the House of Lords. However, weeks later, she has yet to formally resign, leaving Mid Bedfordshire in political limbo. Downing Street has acknowledged the unusual nature of the situation, with the prime minister’s press secretary noting that it is uncommon for an MP to declare an immediate resignation without following through.    Political analysts suggest that Dorries’ delay may be a calculated move to exert pressure on the government, possibly in hopes of securing a peerage through alternative means. However, this strategy has backfired, drawing criticism from across the political spectrum. Local residents, already grappling with issues such as healthcare access, infrastructure funding, and economic challenges, are growing increasingly impatient. Without an active MP, vital constituency concerns risk being overlooked in Westminster.    Community leaders argue that a by-election must be called as soon as possible to ensure Mid Bedfordshire has a dedicated representative in Parliament. The longer Dorries remains in office without fulfilling her duties, the more damage is done to public trust in the political process. As pressure mounts, the question remains: will Dorries finally step aside, or will she continue to hold her seat hostage in pursuit of personal grievances? For the people of Mid Bedfordshire, the answer cannot come soon enough.\n",
      "Paper 4:  The Scottish government has unveiled ambitious proposals outlining how citizenship would function in an independent Scotland, drawing inspiration from Ireland’s inclusive model. First Minister Humza Yousaf presented the plans, which aim to simplify the citizenship process by removing mandatory tests and drastically lowering application fees—a stark contrast to the UK government’s stricter immigration policies. The announcement has reignited tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster, particularly over whether Scottish taxpayer funds should be allocated to preparations for potential independence.    The document, part of the \"Building a New Scotland\" series initiated by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, advocates for a citizenship framework that would automatically grant Scottish nationality to individuals born abroad if at least one parent holds Scottish citizenship. This approach mirrors Ireland’s system, which has long been praised for its flexibility and inclusivity. Additionally, the paper suggests that passports issued by an independent Scotland would adhere to European Union standards, featuring the traditional burgundy red color—a symbolic nod to the nation’s aspirations of rejoining the EU.    Yousaf emphasized the urgency of addressing Scotland’s demographic challenges, particularly its aging population, during a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh with refugees from Ukraine and Syria. He argued that a more welcoming citizenship policy would help attract and retain talent, bolstering the workforce and economic growth. Under the proposed system, individuals would automatically qualify for Scottish citizenship if they are British citizens residing in Scotland, were born in the country, have a parent who is a British citizen born in Scotland, or have lived in Scotland for at least a decade. While dual nationality would be permitted, individuals would retain the right to decline Scottish citizenship or renounce their British status if they choose.    The First Minister acknowledged that some might prefer to keep their British citizenship, stating, \"It’s important to recognize that people will feel strongly about retaining their British identity, and we should respect that choice.\" However, he expressed hope that the vast majority would embrace Scottish citizenship, given its potential benefits, including restored EU membership rights such as freedom of movement. Although rejoining the EU is not guaranteed, the Scottish government has signaled its intent to pursue membership swiftly, a move that would significantly enhance the value of a Scottish passport.    The proposals also include a new visa category for individuals with Scottish grandparents, facilitating easier access to citizenship for diaspora communities. Furthermore, the paper suggests that an independent Scotland could remain part of the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless movement for British and Irish citizens without border checks. This arrangement would maintain longstanding ties while allowing Scotland to forge its own immigration policies.    The announcement has drawn criticism from political opponents, with Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, Neil Bibby, accusing Yousaf of being \"out of touch\" for prioritizing independence discussions amid a severe cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly rejected calls for a second independence referendum, leaving the Scottish National Party (SNP) to frame the next general election as a de facto vote on the issue.    Adding to the controversy, Simon Case, the UK’s top civil servant, recently raised concerns about Scottish government officials working on independence-related policies, calling it \"unusual and a bit worrying.\" Case indicated that new guidance would be issued to clarify the boundaries of civil servants' roles in constitutional matters. Yousaf dismissed these concerns, asserting that the legal basis for the independence papers was sound and accusing opposition parties of attempting to stifle democratic debate.    Experts have weighed in on the feasibility of the proposals, with some praising the ambition while cautioning about practical challenges. Dr. Fiona Hill, a political analyst at the University of Edinburgh, noted, \"The Irish model is an attractive blueprint, but Scotland would need to navigate complex negotiations with both the UK and the EU to realize these plans.\" Others have pointed to potential economic hurdles, particularly if Scotland faces resistance from Westminster in establishing its own immigration and border policies.    As the debate intensifies, the Scottish government remains steadfast in its vision, framing independence as an opportunity to create a more equitable and globally connected nation. Whether these proposals gain traction will depend not only on political will but also on public sentiment as Scotland grapples with its future relationship with the UK and the wider world.\n"

      "The Conservative Party is facing yet another scandal as Lancashire police prepare to contact suspended MP Mark Menzies following explosive allegations that campaign funds were misused to pay off individuals described as \"bad people.\" The controversy has sent shockwaves through Westminster, with Labour leader Keir Starmer demanding a full police investigation and questioning why the Conservative Party took months to act on the claims.    Menzies, who represents Fylde and previously served as a government trade envoy to several South American countries, was suspended by the Conservative Party after reports surfaced that he allegedly pressured an aide to hand over thousands of pounds in the middle of the night to resolve a personal crisis. According to *The Times*, Menzies reportedly called his former campaign manager—now a party volunteer—at 3:15 a.m. in December, claiming he was being held in a flat by \"bad people\" and urgently needed £5,000 for what he described as a \"life and death\" situation. The sum later increased to £6,500, which was allegedly paid from the personal savings of his constituency office manager before being reimbursed from campaign donations.    Lancashire police confirmed they were aware of the reports but noted that no formal complaint had been filed. A spokesperson stated that officers would reach out to those involved to determine whether they wished to pursue the matter further. Legal experts suggest that if the allegations are substantiated, Menzies could face serious consequences, including potential fraud charges. \"Misuse of campaign funds is a serious breach of electoral law,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a political ethics expert at the University of Manchester. \"If money intended for political campaigning was diverted for personal use, this could constitute a criminal offense.\"    The Conservative Party has come under fire for its handling of the situation. Chief Whip Simon Hart reportedly referred the matter to party headquarters three months ago after being approached by a whistleblower, yet no immediate action was taken. Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds has written to her Conservative counterpart, Richard Holden, demanding answers about why the party failed to act sooner and whether it had advised those involved to contact the police. \"The public deserves transparency,\" Dodds wrote. \"These are deeply disturbing allegations, and the Conservative Party must explain why it appears to have dragged its feet.\"    Menzies has denied the claims, stating that he has \"fully complied with all the rules for declarations\" and will not comment further while an investigation is ongoing. However, sources close to the MP have provided a conflicting narrative, suggesting that the incident stemmed from a personal encounter gone wrong. According to one account, Menzies met a man on a dating app and later found himself in a situation where he was pressured into paying thousands under false pretenses. The source claimed that individuals at a second location falsely accused him of causing damage and demanded payment, leaving him fearful of the consequences if he refused.    This scandal is the latest in a string of controversies plaguing the Conservative Party. In recent months, multiple MPs have either resigned or been suspended over misconduct allegations, including William Wragg, who admitted to sharing colleagues' personal details after being blackmailed, and Scott Benton and Peter Bone, who stepped down following parliamentary investigations. The ongoing turmoil has fueled criticism that the party is failing to uphold standards in public life.    Defense Secretary Grant Shapps acknowledged that the Conservatives had been aware of the allegations against Menzies \"for a while\" but claimed that \"further information came to light yesterday,\" prompting the suspension. Meanwhile, Starmer seized on the scandal during a visit to Teesside, arguing that it underscores the need for political change. \"Once again, we're talking about misconduct by Tory MPs,\" he said. \"This is exactly why the country needs a fresh start with Labour.\"    The timing of the revelations is particularly damaging for the Conservatives, coming just weeks before crucial local and mayoral elections. Political analysts suggest that the repeated scandals could further erode public trust in the party. \"Voters are tired of seeing headlines about MPs embroiled in controversy,\" said Professor James Whitaker, a political commentator. \"This kind of story reinforces the perception of a party in disarray.\"    As the investigation unfolds, questions remain about whether the Conservative Party will take further disciplinary action and whether Menzies will retain his seat in Parliament. The case also raises broader concerns about the oversight of campaign finances and the mechanisms in place to hold MPs accountable for misconduct. For now, all eyes are on Lancashire police to determine whether the allegations warrant a criminal inquiry—and whether this scandal will be the tipping point in an already tumultuous political climate.\n",

      "A Conservative MP who was suspended over allegations that campaign funds were misused to pay off “bad people” is to be contacted by police over the matter. Keir Starmer earlier called for a police investigation into allegations that campaign funds were misused by the Fylde MP, Mark Menzies, who was also suspended as a government trade envoy to Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina. Lancashire police said that while no complaint had been made they planned to talk to those involved following reports about the MP, who faces claims that he demanded thousands of pounds from an aide to pay off “bad people” in the middle of the night last December. The Conservatives took action on Wednesday night after the allegations were made public in a report by the Times . Labour wrote to the Conservatives asking whether the party had referred the matter to the police. The Tories have yet to involve the police and say they will decide what to do after concluding their own inquiry. The chief whip, Simon Hart, passed the matter to his party HQ three months ago after being approached by what sources describe as a “whistleblower”. Menzies said in a statement: “I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further.” According to the Times, Menzies phoned his former campaign manager, now a party volunteer, at 3.15am one night in December saying he was locked in a flat by “some bad people” and needed £5,000 as a matter of “life and death”. Hours later, the sum had risen to £6,500, and was said to have been paid from the personal savings of Menzies’ constituency office manager. She was reported to have been reimbursed from campaign donations. Lancashire police said in a statement on Thursday evening: “We are aware of reports in the media relating to a serving member of parliament. No complaint has been made to the police at this stage. We will make contact with those impacted in due course to see whether they wish to make a complaint.” It is understood that this will involve contacting the MP. The case is the latest alleged misconduct scandal to rock the Conservative party. It comes after William Wragg, another MP who has since resigned the Tory whip, claimed he handed over colleagues’ personal numbers to someone who had compromising material on him. As many as eight MPs who were elected as Conservatives in 2019 are now sitting as independents, having lost the whip. This is in addition to others such as Scott Benton and Peter Bone , who both quit as MPs after parliamentary investigations found they breached misconduct rules, and David Warburton, who resigned after allegations of misconduct. Asked about Menzies, Starmer told reporters during a visit to Teesside: “There are obviously a lot of unanswered questions in relation to these allegations. Not least why it seems the Conservative party took so long to act and whether they’ve reported this to the police, who it seems to me should be involved in this. “I’ll be honest, there’s a degree of frustration as well. We’re two weeks away from really important political and mayoral elections … And yet again we’re talking about misbehaviour by Tory MPs and if ever you needed evidence of why we need to turn the page on this … and have a fresh start with Labour, I think it’s in these allegations coming out today.” Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, said on Thursday morning that the Conservatives had been aware of the claims “for a while” but “further information came to light yesterday”. According to an account given to the Times by a source close to Menzies, he asked for the money after meeting a man he met on a dating website. The source said Menzies had gone to the man’s flat before going with another man to a second address, where he continued drinking. People at the address falsely claimed he had been sick and demanded £5,000 for cleaning up and other expenses, according to this account. The source close to Menzies told the Times he paid the money because he was afraid of what would happen if he refused, but had insufficient funds in his own savings. They claimed he offered to repay the sum, but that local Tories who controlled the campaign funds said he did not need to. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, wrote on Thursday to the Conservative party chair, Richard Holden, questioning what she chracterised as an apparent lack of action in relation to the “disturbing” allegations. “The Conservative party has reportedly been aware of these serious accusations for over three months. What action was taken, by whom, and when?” she wrote in the letter. Dodds also asked whether CCHQ had advised those involved to contact the police and whether the party itself had reported the matter. A decade ago, Menzies quit as a ministerial aide after allegations about his behaviour by a Brazilian male escort.\n",

      "The ideological shift away from free-market economics has become one of the defining political transformations of the 21st century. What was once the dominant economic philosophy of the Thatcher-Reagan era has gradually faded from mainstream discourse, replaced by a more interventionist approach embraced by governments, institutions, and even corporate leaders. In her new book, *Ten Years to Save the West*, former British Prime Minister Liz Truss argues that this abandonment of small government and low-tax principles lies at the heart of Britain’s economic stagnation. She directs much of her criticism toward what she describes as an entrenched bureaucratic elite—unelected technocrats who, in her view, routinely override democratic mandates in favor of their own policy preferences.    Truss singles out three key institutions—the Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)—as the primary obstacles to her vision of economic revival. She dismisses them collectively as a \"three-headed hydra,\" an unaccountable power structure that stifles growth and innovation. Yet, while her book presents a forceful defense of her short-lived premiership, there are glaring omissions in her account—particularly the economic turmoil that unfolded during her 49 days in office, a period so brief it was famously outlasted by a lettuce in a viral media stunt.    ### The Bond Market Meltdown: Warnings Ignored?    One of the most dramatic moments of Truss’s tenure was the financial market upheaval triggered by her government’s \"mini-budget,\" a sweeping package of unfunded tax cuts that sent shockwaves through global markets. In her book, she claims that no one warned her about potential instability in the bond markets, nor did anyone raise concerns about liability-driven investments (LDIs), a complex financial instrument used by pension funds. However, this assertion contradicts documented evidence.    Internal briefings prepared for Truss by her own economic advisers explicitly cautioned that markets were already nervous about the UK’s fiscal trajectory. A confidential memo, circulated weeks before the mini-budget, warned that if policy announcements were mishandled, a market crash was a real possibility. This raises questions about whether Truss disregarded expert advice—or whether she simply underestimated the scale of the reaction her policies would provoke.    ### The Pensions Crisis: A Tinderbox Waiting to Ignite    Truss does acknowledge that the LDI crisis played a role in the financial chaos, though she portrays it as an unforeseeable disaster. While it’s true that LDIs were an obscure corner of the pensions market, the Financial Times had already highlighted their vulnerabilities months earlier. The real issue, however, was not just the existence of LDIs but the broader economic environment in which they operated.    By the summer of 2022, global bond yields were already rising as central banks aggressively hiked interest rates to combat inflation fueled by the war in Ukraine. The mini-budget, with its dramatic tax cuts and lack of independent scrutiny, acted as a catalyst for a full-blown crisis. The UK’s borrowing costs surged at an unprecedented rate—so much so that City economists began referring to the spike as the \"moron premium.\" The Bank of England was ultimately forced to intervene to prevent a complete financial meltdown, buying up government bonds to stabilize the market.    ### Comparing Fiscal Risks: Furlough vs. the Mini-Budget    In defending her approach, Truss argues that previous large-scale spending commitments—such as the £70 billion furlough scheme during the pandemic—did not trigger market panic, so why should her tax cuts? This comparison, however, overlooks crucial differences in economic conditions.    First, the furlough scheme was implemented at a time when central banks were actively suppressing borrowing costs through quantitative easing. By 2022, inflation was soaring, and monetary policy had shifted dramatically. Second, Truss’s energy price guarantee—a separate but simultaneous policy—was already set to cost up to £200 billion, meaning her tax cuts added to an already staggering fiscal burden. Unlike furlough, which was widely seen as a necessary emergency measure, her policies lacked broad political or economic consensus.    ### The \"Anti-Growth Coalition\" and Institutional Backlash    Truss’s belief that her policies were sabotaged by a shadowy \"anti-growth coalition\" of bureaucrats, economists, and international institutions is a recurring theme in her book. She points to criticism from the IMF, Goldman Sachs, and even US President Joe Biden as evidence of a coordinated effort to undermine her agenda.    Yet the reality is that skepticism toward her economic plan was not confined to the so-called establishment. Many independent analysts questioned the wisdom of unfunded tax cuts tilted toward high earners, arguing they would do little to stimulate growth. The OBR, which Truss sidelined, was not alone in its concerns—major investment banks and international bodies shared the same doubts.    ### The Bank of England: A Contradictory Critique    Truss’s relationship with the Bank of England is particularly fraught. At times,\n",

      "Raw free-market economics is missing in action. Somewhere between its 1980s ascendancy and today, the media, politicians, civil service and even the corporate mainstream abandoned small government and low taxes. At the heart of Liz Truss’s new book, Ten Years to Save the West , the former prime minister reckons this is the reason for Britain’s economic drift, alongside “unelected technocrats” overruling the “wishes of the people”. The UK’s main economic institutions – the Treasury, Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility (a “three-headed hydra”) – come under fire for standing in the way of her project, launched not with an election mandate but a Tory party selection process. However, could there be other lessons from Truss’s 49 days in power – measurable in the shelf life of a lettuce – unacknowledged in a book with more pages? Bond market meltdown “There was no word of warning about any likely issues with the bond markets, and no one mentioned the issues surrounding liability-driven investments.” The trouble is, this does not appear to be entirely true. Truss’s own economic advisers warned her that markets could crash if her policy changes were not handled with care. Weeks before the mini-budget her team presented her with a paper that said: “The markets are nervous about the UK and about policy options. If immediate economic policy announcements are handled badly then a market crash is possible.” Pensions crisis Truss could more reasonably claim ignorance over liability-driven investments (LDIs). The Financial Times had sounded the alarm two months earlier , but it still remained a relatively obscure corner of the pensions market. But to blame LDIs puts the cart before the horse. “It really was a tinderbox waiting for a spark – and the market upheaval provided it,” writes Truss. But what triggered that market upheaval? Government bond yields had been climbing in the summer of 2022 as the world’s leading central banks raised interest rates to combat soaring inflation after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the mini-budget triggered a far more extreme jump in the UK, in a development labelled the “ moron premium ” by City economists. Over four days, long-dated government bond yields rose by more than the annual increase in 23 of the past 27 years, in a “ doom loop ” as the financial crisis started to feed on itself before the Bank of England stepped in . Smaller than furlough? Truss argues “there had not been a major market reaction against recent spending commitments, including the furlough scheme, which had cost £70bn. In the greater scheme of things, the mini-budget’s effect on government borrowing was relatively small.” However, furlough came in a very different context. First, Truss had already committed to an energy price guarantee that could have cost as much as £200bn over 18 months. Her £45bn in tax cuts added to this already vast borrowing commitment. Second, furlough came as the world’s largest central banks were buying billions of pounds in government bonds – keeping borrowing costs low. With inflation rising, those factors had kicked into reverse. The anti-growth coalition Furlough had been generally well received for preventing the biggest economic collapse in 300 years from becoming far worse by permanently scarring the economy. By contrast, economists thought tax cuts directed at the rich would have a minimal impact on growth. And this was not the view of the OBR (it had not been asked to give one); but of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America . Alongside criticism from the International Monetary Fund and President Joe Biden, Truss says “it became clear we were not just challenging UK economic orthodoxy, this groupthink extended to the leading powers of the west”. The Bank of England In a book railing against short-termism and institutions, Truss reveals she thought about abolishing the OBR and sacking the Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, but concluded such a “declaration of war on the economic establishment” would have taken time she did not have. Her criticism of the central bank is, though, topsy-turvy in places. In one chapter she writes: “Central banks from the Federal Reserve to the Bank of England colluded with spendthrift governments, allowing money-printing to pay for the largesse.” But later she complains that turning off the printing press contributed to her downfall, as it drove up borrowing costs, and grumbles that the bank perhaps did not collude with her enough. Truss is at least right that markets thought the bank was behind the curve with its interest rate stance. But it had made clear mo nths earlier that it would begin reversing its quantitative easing programme by selling government bonds from September 2022. Most economists do not buy that this was the primary contributor to the market meltdown after the mini-budget. It certainly did not help. But then why throw caution to the wind with a radical budget against this backdrop? City bankers blamed the unexpectedly large tax cuts in the mini-budget, particularly plans to scrap the 45p additional rate of income tax , alongside a wider undermining of the UK’s institutional framework: sacking the Treasury permanent secretary, Tom Scholar, sidelining the OBR, and challenging the Bank’s independence. The Bank may have “presided over the drift of economic policy in Britain for 30 years”, but Truss still craved its endorsement. “Given the lukewarm nature of their public statements, which implicitly accepted the criticisms made by our opponents, it is unsurprising that the markets were unconvinced,” she writes. Threadneedle Street is also castigated for having “deliberately cast us adrift” by refusing to issue a full assessment of the economic effects of the mini-budget. However, the Bank has no formal role in reviewing tax and spending decisions – a function left to the OBR, which Truss had sidelined – and normally passes minimal comment on them. It would also have been a challenge when, according to Bailey, it was cut out of the loop and left “blindsided” by her mini-budget plans. The Office for Budget Responsibility Britain has grown to “defer to the revered cult of the technocrat”, Truss writes, with the OBR and the Treasury the pinnacle in a Whitehall establishment full of leftwing “quangocrats” reliant on flawed economic models. Truss may have valid criticism of the OBR’s forecasting record. It has been consistently wrong. But usually because it has been over optimistic . However, the main tax and spending constraints are not set by the OBR but by parliament – to which it is accountable. After the OBR’s establishment under George Osborne, Truss says the agency “developed a life of its own and now essentially sets fiscal policy”. “I’m not aware of any other Treasury anywhere in the world with such a rigid and inflexible arrangement.” Her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, could have changed the fiscal rules dictating how much Britain can borrow – a scorecard the OBR is only responsible for marking, not setting. After all, the UK’s fiscal rules have been changed more frequently than in almost any other advanced economy . But this did not happen.\n",

      "The European Commission has taken a significant step toward mending one of the most contentious fractures left by Brexit—restricted mobility between the UK and the European Union. In a landmark proposal, the Commission announced its intention to negotiate a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people aged 18 to 30 from both the UK and EU member states to live, work, and study in each other’s countries for up to four years. This move represents a notable shift in the EU’s stance, which had previously resisted concessions to the UK following its departure from the bloc.    The proposal, which still requires approval from EU leaders, could mark a turning point in post-Brexit relations, fostering closer ties between the next generation of Europeans and Britons. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen framed the initiative as a natural progression following the Windsor Framework, which eased tensions over Northern Ireland’s trade arrangements. \"Our relationship has become more constructive,\" she noted, emphasizing that youth mobility would serve mutual interests by strengthening cultural and professional bonds.    Under the envisioned agreement, participants would not be restricted to a single purpose—whether work, study, or travel—and would not face quotas, a departure from the rigid constraints of traditional visa systems. However, conditions such as proof of financial stability and health insurance would apply, mirroring similar schemes in countries like Canada and Australia. The proposal also hints at restoring reciprocal tuition fee arrangements, potentially ending the exorbitant overseas fees that have deterred many students from crossing the Channel.    The hospitality and academic sectors, both of which have struggled with labor shortages since Brexit, stand to benefit significantly. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, welcomed the proposal, calling it a long-overdue solution to staffing crises in restaurants, hotels, and seasonal industries. Meanwhile, universities on both sides could see a resurgence in research collaboration, particularly under programs like Horizon Europe, which has suffered from the UK’s diminished participation.    Sweden, a vocal advocate for the scheme, has championed the initiative as a win for young Europeans and Britons alike. Jessika Roswall, Sweden’s Minister for European Affairs, underscored the importance of rebuilding educational and cultural exchanges that were disrupted by Brexit. \"This is about securing opportunities for the next generation,\" she said, reflecting a broader sentiment among EU nations that see youth mobility as a bridge rather than a concession.    The UK government, while cautious not to frame the proposal as a reversal of Brexit’s core principles, has signaled openness to the idea. Officials point to existing bilateral agreements, such as those between France and Canada, as proof that controlled mobility can coexist with national immigration policies. Lord Kinnoull, chair of the House of Lords European Affairs Committee, praised the development, arguing that such a program would deliver \"immense mutual benefits\" without undermining sovereignty.    Critics, however, warn that the scheme could reignite debates over immigration control—a central issue in the Brexit referendum. The Commission has been careful to stress that the proposal does not equate to reinstating free movement, emphasizing time limits and eligibility checks. \"This is not about granting UK citizens the same rights as EU nationals,\" a spokesperson clarified, \"but about creating structured opportunities for temporary exchange.\"    The broader implications of the proposal extend beyond labor markets and universities. By reestablishing personal connections between young Britons and Europeans, the scheme could soften the political and cultural estrangement that has defined recent years. Analysts suggest that fostering familiarity between the two populations may lay the groundwork for more cooperative relations in the future, particularly as a new generation of leaders emerges.    If approved, negotiations could begin as early as May, with EU ministers set to discuss the matter at their next meeting. While hurdles remain—including potential resistance from member states wary of immigration concessions—the fact that the Commission has put forward the proposal signals a willingness to explore pragmatic solutions. For millions of young people who grew up with the ease of pre-Brexit mobility, the scheme offers a glimmer of hope that some of those lost opportunities might be restored.    As discussions progress, the focus will likely shift to the finer details: Will participating countries impose additional restrictions? How will tuition fee reciprocity be implemented? And crucially, will the UK’s political climate allow for such an agreement without backlash? For now, the proposal stands as one of the most tangible efforts to repair the rift caused by Brexit—one that, if successful, could redefine the relationship between Britain and Europe for decades to come.\n",
      "Статья 2:\n",
      "The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of 18- to 30-year-olds in a major concession. It said it would now seek approval from individual EU leaders to start the talks, which could partly eliminate one of the most controversial elements of Brexit, a block on the right to live in one another’s countries, albeit for a limited period and with conditions. Referring to the post-Brexit trading agreement on Northern Ireland, the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Since we have the Windsor agreement in place, the relationship has been much more constructive. “There are certainly topics where we can have closer collaboration … and the topic of youth mobility is in both our interests because the more we have youth mobility being on both sides of the channel, the more we increase the probability we will be on good terms because the next generation knows each other very well.” Under the envisaged agreement, EU and UK citizens aged between 18 and 30 would be able to stay for up to four years in the destination country, the European Commission said in a detailed statement. If agreed, a youth mobility scheme visa would be issued in those countries that participate, with possible conditions including a requirement for health insurance and proof of sufficient subsistence funds, a feature of other mobility schemes around the world. “The objective would be to facilitate youth exchanges, making it easier for young EU citizens to travel, work and live in the UK, with reciprocity for young UK nationals in a member state,” the commission said . The decision by the commission, which has in the past been vehemently opposed to making any concessions to the UK sought since Brexit, is seen as a breakthrough in UK-EU relations. The proposal to open negotiation must first be agreed by EU leaders. Sources say the first opportunity could arise in May at a meeting of general affairs ministers. If approved, it would mean millions of young people could come to the UK to fill the gap left by Brexit in the hospitality sector, and also in universities. It would mean seasonal work, from restaurant work to jobs in ski resorts, would be available again to British young people in EU countries. It may also make it easier for UK and EU universities to recruit researchers, particularly those involved in the Horizon science research programme. Under the scheme it is also envisaged that the university student home-fee system would be restored in both directions, ending the crippling overseas fees which sometimes amounted to more than £40,000 a year. The Swedish minister for European affairs, Jessika Roswall, told the Guardian: “Sweden has pushed for this and we feel this is very important for the youth and students in the EU and the UK, they are the winners.” In its announcement, thecommission said it had acted after the UK had made approaches to individual EU countries, known to include France, to open a youth mobility scheme. UK ministers have argued that it would not be a backtracking on one of the key elements of Brexit, the end of free movement for British citizens. They argued that France already had such an agreement with Canada, and Australia had a similar deal with the UK, and that it would be an important way to foster cultural exchange for future generations. “Mobility would not be purpose-bound, ie beneficiaries should be able to undertake different activities during that period, such as studying, training, working or travelling, neither would mobility be subject to a quota system,” said the commission. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said: “We have been calling for these schemes to be expanded and I’m pleased to see the EU Commission coming to the table with a plan to open negotiations. I hope the EU Council agrees with the proposal and that talks between the UK and EU can begin as soon as possible.” The commission’s statement raises a possibility that it could pave the way for university places in one another’s countries if member states and the UK saw fit. And agreement “would also provide for equal treatment (ie, non-discrimination) between EU and UK citizens in respect of higher education tuition fees”, the statement said. The commission stressed that a youth mobility scheme would not be reinstating free movement as it would come with conditions including a limited stay in one another’s countries. “The envisaged agreement would provide for limited-in-time mobility, subject to the fulfilment of conditions to be checked before the mobility can take place. The conditions should also be met during the stay. It is not about conferring to young UK nationals the benefits of the fundamental freedom of movement enjoyed by EU citizens,” it said. It added that Brexit had particularly “affected the opportunities for young people to experience life on the other side of the channel and to benefit from youth, cultural, educational, research and training exchanges”. It also said that a bloc-wide deal was preferable to a series of bilaterals as it would ensure equal treatment for every person in the scheme. Lord Kinnoull, the chair of the House of Lords European affairs committee, which recommended such a mobility programme, welcomed the development, saying if agreement was reached it would be “greatly to the mutual benefit of both parties and to the youth of Europe”.\n",

      "The political landscape in the UK has been rocked by a series of high-profile developments, spanning financial investigations, climate policy reversals, and growing tensions over campaign funding allegations. These events have unfolded against a backdrop of shifting public opinion, with new polling data suggesting a significant lead for Labour over the Conservatives on key policy issues—including, for the first time in years, national security.    **Peter Murrell Re-Arrested in SNP Finances Probe**   In a dramatic turn of events, Peter Murrell, the former chief executive of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and husband of ex-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been rearrested in connection with an ongoing police investigation into the party’s finances. Murrell, 59, was initially arrested in April 2023 and was taken into custody again early this morning. Police Scotland confirmed the arrest, urging the public to exercise caution in discussing the case due to its active legal status.    The investigation, which has cast a long shadow over the SNP, centers on allegations of financial mismanagement and potential misuse of party funds. Legal experts suggest that the rearrest signals a deepening of the probe, possibly indicating new evidence or lines of inquiry. A spokesperson for the SNP declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Meanwhile, political analysts speculate that the case could have far-reaching implications for the party’s leadership and electoral prospects, particularly as it grapples with internal divisions and declining poll numbers.    **Conservative Party Faces Pressure Over MP’s Alleged Misuse of Funds**   Elsewhere, the Conservative Party is under mounting scrutiny after Labour leader Keir Starmer called for allegations involving MP Mark Menzies to be referred to the police. Menzies, who represents Fylde in Lancashire, is accused of misusing campaign funds, with reports suggesting that a whistleblower raised concerns with Chief Whip Simon Hart three months ago.    Conservative Party sources confirm that an internal inquiry is underway but have resisted calls to involve law enforcement at this stage. They argue that the initial approach from the whistleblower did not constitute a formal complaint, though critics dismiss this as semantic evasion. Menzies has strongly denied the allegations, but the controversy has intensified pressure on Rishi Sunak’s government, already struggling with declining public trust.    Political ethics experts warn that failure to act decisively could further erode confidence in Westminster. \"Transparency is crucial in these matters,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a governance specialist at the University of London. \"If there’s credible evidence of wrongdoing, it should be investigated independently—not just internally.\"    **Scotland Scraps Key Climate Target, Sparking Outrage**   In a move that has drawn fierce criticism from environmental groups, the Scottish government has abandoned its legally binding target to cut carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. Net Zero Secretary Màiri McAllan admitted the goal was now \"out of reach,\" blaming insufficient policy support from Westminster and global economic challenges.    The decision has been branded the \"worst environmental decision in the history of devolution\" by campaigners. Imogen Dow of Friends of the Earth Scotland accused ministers of betraying future generations, while Professor Piers Forster of the UK’s Climate Change Committee called the reversal \"deeply disappointing.\"    Despite the backlash, First Minister Humza Yousaf insisted that Scotland’s commitment to achieving net zero by 2045—five years ahead of the UK target—remains unchanged. However, critics argue that without interim milestones, the long-term goal risks becoming unenforceable.    **Labour Gains Ground in Polls, Even on Defence**   New polling data from Lord Ashcroft reveals a striking shift in public opinion, with Labour now leading the Conservatives on every major policy issue—including defence, traditionally a Tory stronghold. Just 15% of voters said they would trust Rishi Sunak over Keir Starmer in the event of a national security crisis, a finding that has sent shockwaves through Conservative ranks.    The poll underscores the broader challenges facing Sunak’s government, which has struggled to regain momentum amid economic stagnation and internal party strife. With Labour consistently ahead in national surveys, political strategists suggest the Conservatives may need a radical reset to avoid a landslide defeat in the next general election.    **UK Considers Crackdown on Tech Investments in Hostile States**   In a bid to bolster national security, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has announced that the government is considering measures to prevent British firms from funding emerging technologies in countries deemed hostile. The move, which could target sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, reflects growing concerns over foreign espionage and technological warfare.    Security analysts warn that the UK must strike a delicate balance between protecting its interests and maintaining global economic ties. \"Overly restrictive measures could stifle innovation,\" said Dr. Jonathan Briggs, a defence policy expert. \"But unchecked investment in adversarial nations poses real risks.\"    **Inheritance Tax Loopholes Under Scrutiny**   A\n",

      "6.21pm BST Thank you for following developments today. We are now closing this blog, you can read all our UK politics coverage here . 5.33pm BST Afternoon summary Peter Murrell, the former Scottish National party chief executive and husband of the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been rearrested in connection with Police Scotland’s investigation into the party’s finances. The Conservative party is resisting calls from Keir Starmer for allegations that campaign funds were misused by the MP Mark Menzies to be referred to the police. (See 5.21pm .) The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of 18- to 30-year-olds in a major concession . Climate campaigners have accused Scottish ministers of being “inept” and “short-termist” after they scrapped Scotland’s target to cut carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. It would be wrong to attribute the UK’s wealth and economic success to its colonial history or racial privilege, the business and trade minister, Kemi Badenoch, has said. Updated at 5.35pm BST 5.21pm BST Conservative party HQ resists calls to refer Mark Menzies allegations to police The Conservative party has not responded to Labour’s question about whether it has referred the Mark Menzies allegation to the police and it has certainly not announced that the police are being called in. It has also declined to respond to all the other questions raised by Labour. (See 10.52am and 2.24pm .) But party sources have confirmed that an investigation into Menzies is under way. It is understood that a whisteblower approached Simon Hart, the chief whip, three months ago, and the matter was referred to CCHQ. Initially the whistleblower did not want Menzies to know that concerns had been raised. An inquiry only started when the whistleblower was happy for it to go ahead. Sources say there is a lot of information to process and the inquiry is still going ahead. They suggest that whether or not there is a referral to the police will depend on the outcome. The party maintains that the original approach from the whistleblower did not amount to a “complaint”. But this sounds like semantics. On the basis of what the Times is alleging, it has hard to see how this would not have sounded like a complaint. Menzies says he strongly disputes the allegations that have been made. 5.17pm BST Nicola Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell re-arrested by police over probe into SNP's finances Peter Murrell, former SNP chief executive and husband of ex-first minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been re-arrested in connection with the police investigation into the party’s finances, PA Media reports. PA says the 59-year-old was previously arrested on 5 April last year in the same investigation and was taken into custody this morning. Police Scotland said in a statement: A 59-year-old man has today, Thursday, 18 April 2024, been re-arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party. The man, who was previously arrested as a suspect on 5 April 2023, was taken into custody at 9.13am and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives. The matter remains active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the public are therefore advised to exercise caution if discussing it on social media. As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further at this time. 4.55pm BST Scottish government accused of 'worst environmental decision in history of devolution' after 2030 emissions target dropped Holyrood ministers have been accused of making the “worst environmental decision in the history of devolution” as the Scottish government abandoned a key climate change target, PA Media reports. Environmental campaigners hit out after Scottish net zero secretary Màiri McAllan conceded the goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030 is now “out of reach”. With the target enshrined in law, the Scottish government – which includes the Greens thanks to a powersharing agreement with the SNP – will now bring forward new legislation to ensure climate change targets “better reflect the reality of long-term climate policymaking”, McAllan told MSPs. This will also see the Scottish government move away from legally-binding annual targets – which it has missed for eight out of 12 years. But McAllan stressed Scotland’s target to reach net zero by 2045 – five years earlier than the UK – will remain. Humza Yousaf had earlier told MSPs his government will “not move back by a single month, a week or even a day from that 2045 target”. Prof Piers Forster, interim chairman of the UK’s Climate Change Committee , said the removal of the 2030 target is “deeply disappointing”. Friends of the Earth Scotland ’s head of campaigns Imogen Dow said: SNP and Green ministers choosing the scrap these climate commitments is the worst environmental decision in the history of the Scottish parliament. The 2030 target could and should have been met, but instead politicians are going to break their promises and betray both their constituents and the most vulnerable people already enduring the impacts of climate breakdown. 4.38pm BST A reader asks: Do the Conservatives have the kind of rules that I believe Labour do, which would mean that MPs who have had the whip withdrawn will not be standing as Conservative candidates unless it’s restored before an election is called? Yes, they do. 4.07pm BST Labour ahead of Tories on all key issues, including defence, poll suggests The Ipsos poll out today (see 10.15am and 11.56am ) is not the only one out today providing a grim read for No 10. Lord Ashcroft , the former Tory deputy chair and Angela Rayner biographer, has for years run a well-regarded polling operation, and his latest poll shows Labour ahead of the Conservatives on every issue of importance to voters, including defence. In an article on the findings, Ashcroft writes: In a survey just under a year ago I found that defence and national security was the one area in which the Conservatives were still trusted more than Labour. As the world seems to become more unstable by the week, and with UK forces taking part in an operation to shoot down Iranian drones, might these issues come to play a bigger part in people’s voting decisions, to the Tories’ advantage? There is certainly evidence that defence is on the minds of more voters. Only 8% named it among the top three issues facing the country a year ago, compared to 13% today. But four times as many mention the cost of living and even more name the NHS. In any case, the Conservatives should not expect a dividend if national security is climbing the political agenda. My latest poll now finds Labour to be ahead on the issue, for the first time I can remember in my years of polling. Only 28% of voters think Labour would do a better job on defence, but the Tories languish on 26%, with nearly half of voters saying they don’t know. In the event of an armed conflict that threatened the UK, only just over one in five say they would trust Keir Starmer more than Rishi Sunak to lead and make good decisions, but only 15% say the reverse. Sir Keir is hardly the new Sir Winston, but defence is not the firm Tory territory it once was. It is not just the poll numbers that will worry Rishi Sunak; he will be even more worried about the fact that the Daily Mail, which is normally reliably pro-Tory, made the story its splash.

Kiran Stacey has the story here. Related: UK firms may be barred from funding emerging tech in hostile countries Updated at 3.51pm BST 3.34pm BST IFS says closing 3 inheritance tax loopholes could raise almost £4bn a year by end of decade Labour has announced only a very small number of measures to increase the amount it would raise through tax and none of them affect what might be described as taxes paid by ordinary people. But Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has in the past suggested that she might raise more by closing “loopholes”, and she so is likely to take a close interest in a report published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today saying the government could raise almost £3bn by closing three inheritance tax loopholes. It says removing business relief for AIM (Alternative investment market) shares could raise £1.1bn this year; capping agricultural and business relief at £500,000 per person would raise £1.4bn; and including the value of defined contribution pensions in estates would raise £200m. By 2029-30 those measures would raise almost £4bn a year (£1.6bn, £1.8bn and £400m respectively), it says. David Sturrock, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies , said: Inheritance tax is littered with special reliefs and exemptions which make the tax unfair. The spring budget introduced yet another relief to this long list. Rather than gradually carving out more and more assets from the tax, the government should take steps to reduce or eliminate some of the major exemptions in the system. Eliminating the special treatment given to some shares, capping reliefs for business and agricultural assets, and bringing pension pots into the scope of the tax would make the system fairer and raise revenues. 3.12pm BST Kemi Badenoch says UK's wealth does not come from colonialism or white privilege It would be wrong to attribute the UK’s wealth and economic success to its colonial history or racial privilege, the business and trade minister, Kemi Badenoch , has told an audience in the City. Kalyeena Makortoff has the story here. Related: Kemi Badenoch: UK’s wealth isn’t from white privilege and colonialism 2.46pm BST Starmer restates 'complete confidence' in Rayner In his interview clip for broadcasters, Keir Starmer also restated his “complete confidence” in Angela Rayner. And he said the fact there is now a police investigation into issues relating to a house purchase and Rayner’s living arrangements before she became an MP should “draw a line” under the affair. Asked if he still had complete faith in his deputy, Starmer replied: Angela has answered no end of questions on this. She’s said she’s happy to answer any further questions. I have complete confidence in her and the police investigation, I think, allows a line to be drawn in relation to this. By “allows a line to be drawn” etc, Starmer seemed to be saying that he thought the fact that the police are investigating should put a stop to the need for any further media comment until the inquiry is over. He also said Rayner would be out with the party campaigning in the local elections. Updated at 2.47pm BST 2.31pm BST 2.24pm BST Starmer calls for police investigation into Mark Menzies allegations Keir Starmer has called for the police to launch an inquiry into some of the allegations made by a Times story that has led to Mark Menzies MP being suspended from the Conservative party. Asked for his response to the report, Starmer told broadcasters: There are obviously a lot of unanswered questions in relation to these allegations, not least why it seems the Conservative party took so long to act and whether they’ve reported this to the police, who it seems to me should be involved in this. Starmer also claimed the Menzies allegations showed why voters should “turn the page on this shower and have a fresh start with Labour”. He said: We’re two weeks away from really important local and mayoral elections when you know there’s a lot of positive arguments that we want to make about the change we can bring about elections. And yet again we’re talking about misbehaviour by Tory MPs. If ever you needed evidence of why we need to turn the page on this shower and have a fresh start with Labour, I think it’s in these allegations coming out today. Labour has already sent a letter to Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, challenging him to provide answers to a whole series of questions raised by the Times story about Menzies. (See 12.31pm .) For the record, here are the questions from that Labour leader, sent by Anneliese Dodds , the party chair. The Conservative party has reportedly been aware of these serious accusations for over three months. What action was taken, by whom, and when? When did CCHQ become aware of this incident? On being made aware of this incident, did CCHQ advise the person involved to contact the police themselves? When presented with evidence of an MP involving junior staff in paying thousands of pounds to ‘bad people’, did you immediately report this matter to the police? And if you have not yet, why not and will you do so today? Will you give the police full access to all evidence you have in this case? At least one of Menzies’ donors is reported to have given a “four-figure sum” to the Fylde group. Has this been declared with the Electoral Commission? Is it common practice for Conservative party MPs to use money donated for campaigning activities to instead pay their personal expenses? According to the Conservative party constitution, the board of the Conservative party is responsible for the Conservative party’s compliance with PPERA [Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act]. As chairman of the Conservatives, you chair the board in the absence of Rishi Sunak. Can you confirm that you and the board have completely satisfied your obligations under PPERA? Can you further confirm that the Conservative party are fully compliant with all relevant UK electoral and donations law? In a statement about the allegations, first report by the Times, Menzies said: I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further. Updated at 2.34pm BST 1.45pm BST Quarter of Tory voters think Angela Rayner story 'sounds like smear', poll suggests Around a quarter of Conservative supporters believe the row about Angela Rayner’s housing arrangements before she became an MP “sounds like a smear campaign”, according to new polling . The Savanta polling, commissioned by the pro-Labour website LabourList, found that amongst the population as a whole 40% of people say the story sounds like a smear. Amongst Labour voters that figure is 56%, and amongst Tory voters that figure is 26%. Tom Belger , editor of LabourList, said: Labour has attacked rightwing ‘smears’ against Angela Rayner, and this poll suggests a striking number of Tory and Labour voters alike agree there are political reasons this story is getting so much attention. Updated at 1.45pm BST 1.34pm BST Pupil suspensions in England hit record high, rising by nearly a third year on year, DfE figures show The number of pupil suspensions in England has risen by nearly a third in a year to more than 260,000, PA Media reports. PA says: Data from the Department for Education (DfE) shows there were 263,904 suspensions in the spring term of 2022/23, compared to 201,090 during the spring term of 2021/22 – a rise of 31%. The number of suspensions in spring 2023 is the “highest” termly figure recorded, the DfE said. Suspensions are typically higher in the autumn term, but the figures show the number rose by 7% from autumn 2022 (when there were 247,366 suspensions) to spring 2023. The rise of suspensions – which are when a pupil is excluded from a school for a set period of time – comes amid warnings of challenging behaviour in classrooms following the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of permanent exclusions also increased in the spring term of last year compared to the same period in 2022. There were 3,039 permanent exclusions in spring 2023, compared to 2,179 in spring 2022 – a rise of 39%, the figures show. The most common reason for suspensions and permanent exclusions was persistent disruptive behaviour, the DfE said. 1.25pm BST In the Commons William Wragg, the MP who recently resigned the Tory whip after admitting divulging colleagues’ phone numbers to a stranger threatening him on WhatsApp, had been due to open a backbench debate on access to redress schemes, according to the Commons order paper. But he did not speak, and the Lib Dem MP Richard Foord opened the debate instead. He said compensation schemes like those for victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal were “frequently blighted by unnecessary complexity, delays [and] a huge emotional and legal burden on the victims”. Redress schemes should be “effective, timely, proportionate and fair”, he argued. 1.14pm BST No 10 says it hopes to end Commons/Lords deadlock on Rwanda bill on Monday night During questions in the Commons on next week’s business, Penny Mordaunt , leader of the house, said that MPs would debate the latest Lords amendments to the Rwanda bill on Monday and that, if necessary, time would also be set aside on Tuesday for MPs to vote again on Lords amendments to the bill. But, at the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists that the government wants to conclude the “ping pong” process (when the bill shuttles between the Commons and the Lords until both sides agree on its wording) on Monday night. He said: Our intention is to get this passed on Monday such that we can then set out the timetable for getting flights off as soon as possible. Downing Street is prepared, if necessary, for the Commons and the Lords to sit late into the night until the deadlock is broken. Ultimately, the Lords almost always does back down, but sometimes peers might send a bill back to the Commons up to about five times in the hope of getting ministers to “think again” and grant concessions. When the Lords first debated the Rwanda bill, they inserted 10 amendments that were later removed by MPs. Since then, rather than accept the government version, peers have now sent the bill back to the Commons three times with changes opposed by the government. The last debate was last night, when peers dug their heels in on just two issues. Related: Rwanda bill further delayed after Lords again votes for changes At the lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson indicated that the government would not be making any further concessions on the bill. But the spokesperson did not offer a clear explanation as to why MPs were not debating the bill again until Monday afternoon. It had been expected that they might debate it again late last night, or today. 12.31pm BST Anneliese Dodds , the Labour party chair, has written an open letter to Richard Holden, her Tory counterpart, raising questions over his party’s handling of the allegations about Mark Menzies. As PA Media reports, Dodds said the allegations raised “extremely serious questions relating to potential criminality” and asked whether the matter had been or would be reported to the police. She also asked when the Conservative party had become aware of the allegations, what action had been taken and whether it was “common practice for Conservative party MPs to use money donated for campaigning activities to instead pay their personal expenses”. She wrote: A long-serving Tory worker involved in this disturbing incident says they believe the Conservative party wants to ‘brush it under the carpet’. I trust you will now take all steps to show this is not the case. In a statement about the allegations, first report by the Times, Menzies said: I strongly dispute the allegations put to me. I have fully complied with all the rules for declarations. As there is an investigation ongoing I will not be commenting further. 12.25pm BST Mark Menzies suspended from role as unpaid trade envoy to Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, No 10 says Mark Menzies MP has been suspended from his role as one of Rishi Sunak’s envoys following allegations he misused campaign funds, PA Media reports. At the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokeperson said Menzies had been suspended from the unpaid, voluntary role aimed at boosting trade with Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina. Updated at 12.36pm BST 11.56am BST The polling company Ipsos has now published online the charts accompanying the polling it released today showing Rishi Sunak’s approval rating at a record low. (See 10.15am .) Here is the chart comparing Sunak’s ratings with other prime ministers’. And here is the chart comparing Keir Starmer’s ratings with other opposition leaders’. It shows that, compared to other opposition leaders at the same point after their election, Starmer is doing a lot better than Jeremy Corbyn, a lot worse than David Cameron and Neil Kinnock, and about the same as Ed Miliband and William Hague on this measure. Those final three words in the paragraph above are important. On the net satisfaction measure, Starmer is only average as opposition leader. But if you judge him by how popular his party has become under his leadership (a more relevant measure if you care about election results), Starmer is doing far better than any opposition leader since Tony Blair. 11.35am BST Neil Gray , the Scottish government’s health secretary, has welcomed the decision of two health boards – one of which covers the only gender clinic in the country for young people – to pause the prescription of puberty blockers to new patients, PA Media reports. PA says: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) and NHS Lothian said the decision came with the support of Scotland’s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Gregor Smith, following a review by Dr Hilary Cass in England and the same decision being taken south of the border. NHSGGC covers Scotland’s only gender clinic for under-18s while NHS Lothian provides care to those aged 17 and over at its Chalmers gender identity clinic. Gray said it was right for the decision to be made by clinicians rather than politicians, adding that the Scottish government and boards are considering the recommendations of the Cass Review. Updated at 4.08pm BST 11.22am BST Mordaunt says government won't change Commons procedure to allow all MPs to question Lord Cameron on foreign affairs During business questions Lucy Powell , the shadow leader of the Commons, also asked Penny Mordaunt why the government is refusing to change parliamentary rules to allow David Cameron, who sits in the Lords as foreign secretary, to be questioned by all MPs. After Cameron’s surprise appointment last year, Mordaunt initially suggested she was open to the idea of all MPs getting the chance to question Cameron, perhaps in Westminster Hall. In January the Commons procedure committee published a report proposing instead that all MPs should get the chance to question Cameron, and other secretaries of states who sit in the House of Lords, by allowing them to take questions at the bar of the Commons chamber (the line in the carpet near the entrance to the chamber, where non-MPs stand or sit if summoned to appear). But in its reponse to this report , which has just been published, the government has said it will not adopt this proposal. (It does not categorically reject the idea, but it argues the current arrangements work well, it claims letting MPs question ministers from the Lords at the bar of the Commons would create various practical problems, and it says it would welcome “further consideration” of the proposal.) Mordaunt told Powell that the government was going to stick to the current rules because MPs already have plenty of opportunity to question ministers about foreign policy. She said that, since Cameron was appointed foreign secretary, there have been eight ministerial statements on foreign policy, three prime ministerial statements on foreign policy, a debate on the situation in the Red Sea and 17 Westminster Hall debates on foreign policy, as well as the usual question time sessions. In its reponse to the procedure committee, the government said: Throughout its history, the Commons has called non-members to give evidence in various formats, and in living memory the preferred format for scrutiny of non-members has been via select committees. This is an arrangement that has worked well in facilitating Commons scrutiny of secretaries of state in the House of Lords, and Lord Cameron has already given evidence to select committees in the Commons since his appointment. By contrast, the use of the bar of the House for routine scrutiny of non-members is entirely untested. Indeed, there is no evidence yet brought forward that suggests any Peer has responded to routine scrutiny from members of parliament at the bar of the House of Commons. A lack of modern – or even historic – precedent does not mean that the Commons should not consider novel measures to achieve the level of scrutiny it demands. It does, however, demand thorough consideration of the potential consequences of such a procedural change. Updated at 11.23am BST 10.52am BST Labour says Tory response to Mark Menzies allegations 'too weak' and suggests they should be reported to police In the Commons Lucy Powell , the shadow leader of the Commons, asked Penny Mordaunt when the government first knew about the allegations against Mark Menzies. And she asked if the matter had been referred to the police. “If not, why not?” She went on: It seems that yet again, like with [William Wragg] and so many of the recent cases of sleaze and scandal, they’re too weak to act decisively and instead choose to brush things under the carpet. The truth is, they’ve given up on governing. In her response, Mordaunt , the leader of the Commons, did not refer directly to the Menzies case, but she said some “very serious allegations” had come to light during the Easter recess (she seemed to be referring primarily to the Wragg revelations] and she said she could not comment on them. Updated at 10.54am BST 10.15am BST Sunak's approval rating hits record low for a PM, poll suggests Rishi Sunak’s approval rating is at a record low for a prime minister in modern times, according to the polling company Ipsos. In its latest Political Monitor report it says net satisfaction with Sunak (% satisfied with how he is doing his job minus % dissatisfied) is now at -59. This matches John Major’s -59 score in August 1994, the record low for a prime minister in the Ipsos data going back to the 1980s. The record low for an opposition leader on net satisfication was the -60 that Jeremy Corbyn achieved in September 2019. Keir Starmer’s appoval rating has also fallen, although it is still a lot higher than Sunak’s. Ipsos says: Starmer’s ratings have also fallen since February. 25% are satisfied with his performance as Labour leader (-4) and 56% are dissatisfied (+1). His net score of -31 is his worst as Labour leader since he recorded a -29 in May 2021. Among Labour supporters, satisfaction with his performance has also dropped from 58% to 51%. Ipsos found that, when people were asked who would make the most capable PM, Starmer has a clear lead over Sunak. When presented with a head-to-head choice, the public think Keir Starmer would make the most capable prime minister over Rishi Sunak by a margin of 22 points (44% to 22%). 22% say neither and 10% don’t know. This is an increase in Keir Starmer’s lead since January (from 13 points to 22), and is similar to Starmer’s 20pt lead over Boris Johnson in July 2022. Although 2019 Conservative voters still prefer Sunak over Starmer by 49% to 20%. On voting intention, Ipsos has Labour on 44% (down 3 points from February), the Conservatives on 19% (down 1 point), Reform UK on 13% (up 5), and the Lib Dems on 9% (unchanged). Ipsos also found that none of the potential alternative Tory leaders it included in its survey were seen as capable of being a better PM than Starmer. It says: Nobody from a list of 6 potential alternative Conservative leaders stands out as doing particularly better versus Keir Starmer in a head-to-head contest Starmer leads each of the following as most capable PM: -Penny Mordaunt by 17 points (42% to 25%). 10% say neither and 22% don’t know. -James Cleverly by 29 points (47% to 18%). 11% neither. 24% don’t know. -Grant Shapps by 33 points (47% to 14%). 12% neither. 26% don’t know. -Kemi Badenoch by 34 points (48% to 14%). 9% say neither. 29% say don’t know. -Suella Braverman by 35 points (53% to 18%). 10% say neither and 19% don’t know. -Priti Patel by 35 points 9.51am BST 9.40am BST Grant Shapps attacks Labour over Rwanda bill and says RAF planes could be used for deportation Good morning. Yesterday Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, plonked himself on the moral high ground yesterday, issuing a statement attacking Keir Starmer for ignoring the “serious ethics scandal” around Angela Rayner. He is looking rather less principled today in the light of extraordinary allegations in the Times about Mark Menzies MP. 🔺 EXCLUSIVE: A Tory MP is under investigation over allegations that he misused campaign funds and abused his position after making a late-night phone call saying he’d been locked up by “bad people” who were demanding thousands of pounds | ✍️ @billykenber https://t.co/KRP4AS56C1 — The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes) April 17, 2024 Our write-up of the story is here . According to Billy Kenber in the Times, CCHQ (which means Holden) knew about the Menzies allegations more than three months ago, but did not suspend him until the Times published his story. Menzies says he strongly disputes the allegations made in the story. Grant Shapps , the defence secretary, was on media round duties for the government this morning. He said that there should be a proper investigation into the allegations, but the Menzies sounded like “potentially somebody who’s quite troubled”. It is not clear if the story will move on much today, and for legal reasons there is a limit to how much we can say, and so the story won’t feature much in the blog today. If people start commenting on it directly BTL, comments may get closed. In his interviews, Shapps was also asked about the government’s Rwanda policy. The government had been hoping to get its Rwanda bill onto the statute book this week but last night the Lords voted again to insert two safeguards opposed by the Commons and, instead of getting MPs to vote again on the bill today, ministers have postponed the next debate until next week. Related: Rwanda bill further delayed after Lords again votes for changes In his Times Radio interview, Shapps claimed that this showed Labour did not want the bill to pass, and that it wanted small boat arrivals to continue. He said: Labour have once again locked the ability for parliament to pass this law. Labour don’t seem to have an answer [to the small boat problem], they don’t seem to want it [the Rwanda policy] to happen. It’s directly at Keir Starmer’s door if they don’t go [ie, if asylum seekers are not send to Rwanda]. Labour sources say they do expect the bill to become law, and that it could have become law this week if ministers had scheduled more “ping pong” debates last night or today. In his interviews Shapps also confirmed that RAF planes could be used for deportation flights to Rwanda. As PA Media reports, it is understood RAF Voyager aircraft could be deployed after the Home Office failed to find an airline that would charter the flights. Downing Street has drawn up plans to order the Ministry of Defence to repurpose at least one of the leased aircraft for this, according to The Times. Asked about this on Sky News this morning, Shapps said: We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get these flights off, whether they are charter flights or other kinds of flights. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, takes questions on the Commons. 10.15am: Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, speaks at the CityUK conference in London. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, gives a speech at Chatham House. 12pm: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions from MSPs at Holyrood. Afternoon: William Wragg, the MP who recently resigned the Tory whip after admitting divulging colleagues’ phone numbers to a stranger threatening him on WhatsApp, is due to speak in the Commons, opening a backbench debate on access to redress schemes. Afternoon: Màiri McAllan, the Scottish government’s climate minister, is due to make an announcement to MSPs ditching a greenhouse gas target for 2030. Also, Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and Ed Miliband are doing a visit today in the north-east of England to promote Labour’s plans for investments in ports. And David Cameron, the foreign secretary, is a the G7 foreign ministers’ summit on the Italian island of Capri. If you want to contact me, do use the “send us a message” feature.

      "The British government is weighing new measures to prevent UK investors from financing advanced technological projects in foreign nations deemed hostile, amid growing concerns that such investments could inadvertently strengthen adversaries' military and intelligence capabilities. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden outlined the potential policy shift in a speech at the Chatham House think tank, signaling a cautious but deliberate approach to safeguarding national security while maintaining the UK’s reputation as an open economy.    Dowden acknowledged that while only a small fraction of British overseas investments might pose security risks, even minimal financial flows could have outsized consequences if they accelerate technological advancements in adversarial states. \"There is a possibility that a very limited number of outbound investments could facilitate significant enhancements in cutting-edge capabilities that may ultimately harm the UK,\" he said. The proposed restrictions would focus on highly sensitive sectors—mirroring recent actions by the United States, which has already moved to block American funding in Chinese semiconductor, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence ventures.    When pressed on which countries might be targeted by these measures, Dowden pointed to China as the primary concern, describing it as the \"number one state-based threat to our economic security.\" However, he also emphasized that the policy would extend to other hostile regimes, including Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The announcement arrives at a delicate moment in UK-China relations, which have been strained by allegations of cyberattacks linked to Beijing and long-standing suspicions over Chinese technology firms like Huawei.    Despite these tensions, Dowden sought to strike a balance, insisting that the UK remains \"open for business\" and that investment restrictions would be narrowly tailored to avoid stifling legitimate economic activity. His remarks reflect a broader debate within Western governments about how to counter technological espionage and intellectual property theft without resorting to blanket economic decoupling.    One area of particular vulnerability, according to Dowden, is the higher education sector. British universities, renowned for their research in sensitive technologies, have increasingly relied on foreign funding—some of which originates from countries with questionable intentions. Recent reports have revealed collaborations between UK academics and institutions tied to the Chinese military, raising alarms about the potential militarization of civilian research.    In response, Dowden announced plans to convene university vice-chancellors for discussions on mitigating these risks. \"We must ensure that universities' reliance on foreign funding does not become a dependency that leaves them open to undue influence or coercion,\" he warned. The move underscores the government’s broader strategy of tightening oversight without alienating the academic community, which depends on international partnerships for innovation.    Experts in cybersecurity and international trade have welcomed the government’s cautious approach but warn that enforcement will be key. \"The challenge lies in distinguishing between benign research collaborations and those with dual-use potential,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. \"Overregulation could stifle scientific progress, but under-regulation could leave critical vulnerabilities exposed.\"    Meanwhile, business leaders have expressed concerns about the potential economic fallout. \"Any restrictions must be transparent and predictable to avoid deterring legitimate investors,\" argued Jonathan Reynolds, director of the Confederation of British Industry’s international trade division. \"The UK's strength lies in its ability to attract global capital, and we must not undermine that without clear justification.\"    As the government prepares to launch a formal consultation on the proposed investment controls, the debate over economic security versus openness is likely to intensify. With geopolitical tensions rising and technological competition accelerating, the UK faces a difficult balancing act—one that will shape its economic and strategic future for years to come.\n",
      "Статья 2:\n",
      "Ministers are considering blocking British investors from funding emerging technologies in hostile countries if they believe the technology could pose a threat to UK security, the deputy prime minister has said. Oliver Dowden said on Thursday the government would consult on curbing British investment abroad, after becoming concerned that money from the UK could be used to finance projects that could undermine national security. His comments come eight months after the Biden administration gave regulators the power to stop US investment in Chinese institutions in three sectors: semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. In a speech at the Chatham House thinktank, Dowden said: “A careful review of the evidence suggests that it’s possible that a very small proportion of outbound investments could present national security issues. Indeed, they might be fuelling technological advances that enhance military and intelligence capabilities of countries of concern.” He added: “We have a problem here that we should look at … in a very small number of very critical areas where we actually believe that outbound investment from the United Kingdom could facilitate significant enhancements in adversarial cutting-edge capability in a way that may be detrimental to the United Kingdom. “It is that sort of very precise area of intervention that we’re looking at.” Pushed to say which countries he would consider a risk, the deputy prime minister said: “We set out into the integrated review refresh that China was the number one state-based threat to our economic security. “So I’m not blind to the fact that a lot of this will relate to China but equally it will relate to hostile states such as Iran, Russia and North Korea.” Dowden’s speech comes at a sensitive time for UK-Chinese relations. The government has shifted its stance towards Chinese technology in recent years amid growing international concern that equipment supplied by companies such as Huawei could be used for espionage. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has attempted to reset fractious relations with Beijing in recent months, but that effort was dealt a blow last month when it emerged Chinese hackers were behind cyber-attacks on politicians and the Electoral Commission. Dowden said on Thursday: “Our open economy is being targeted by state-based actors and their proxies across our inbound and outbound investment flows, our imports and exports and academic collaborations.” But in contrast with the more hawkish US rhetoric on Chinese investment, he also insisted: “We are open for business and my priority and presumption will always be in favour of investment.” The deputy prime minister singled out universities as particularly at risk of being manipulated by foreign governments, both because their researchers were likely to be targets and because academic institutions were so open to international investment. Last month, the Financial Times revealed that academics at Imperial College London had worked with scientists at institutions linked to the Chinese military on research with potential military applications. Dowden said he was summoning university vice-chancellors for a briefing on the kinds of technological threat to guard against. “We should be proud that much of the cutting-edge development in sensitive technologies is happening at our universities,” he said but added this could be a security risk. “We must ensure that universities’ reliance on foreign funding does not become a dependency” through which they can be “influenced, exploited or even coerced”.\n",

      "The Scottish government has unveiled ambitious proposals outlining how citizenship would function in an independent Scotland, drawing inspiration from Ireland’s inclusive model. First Minister Humza Yousaf presented the plans, which aim to simplify the citizenship process by removing mandatory tests and drastically lowering application fees—a stark contrast to the UK government’s stricter immigration policies. The announcement has reignited tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster, particularly over whether Scottish taxpayer funds should be allocated to preparations for potential independence.  The document, part of the \"Building a New Scotland\" series initiated by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, advocates for a citizenship framework that would automatically grant Scottish nationality to individuals born abroad if at least one parent holds Scottish citizenship. This approach mirrors Ireland’s system, which has long been praised for its flexibility and inclusivity. Additionally, the paper suggests that passports issued by an independent Scotland would adhere to European Union standards, featuring the traditional burgundy red color—a symbolic nod to the nation’s aspirations of rejoining the EU.  Yousaf emphasized the urgency of addressing Scotland’s demographic challenges, particularly its aging population, during a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh with refugees from Ukraine and Syria. He argued that a more welcoming citizenship policy would help attract and retain talent, bolstering the workforce and economic growth. Under the proposed system, individuals would automatically qualify for Scottish citizenship if they are British citizens residing in Scotland, were born in the country, have a parent who is a British citizen born in Scotland, or have lived in Scotland for at least a decade. While dual nationality would be permitted, individuals would retain the right to decline Scottish citizenship or renounce their British status if they choose.  The First Minister acknowledged that some might prefer to keep their British citizenship, stating, \"It’s important to recognize that people will feel strongly about retaining their British identity, and we should respect that choice.\" However, he expressed hope that the vast majority would embrace Scottish citizenship, given its potential benefits, including restored EU membership rights such as freedom of movement. Although rejoining the EU is not guaranteed, the Scottish government has signaled its intent to pursue membership swiftly, a move that would significantly enhance the value of a Scottish passport.  The proposals also include a new visa category for individuals with Scottish grandparents, facilitating easier access to citizenship for diaspora communities. Furthermore, the paper suggests that an independent Scotland could remain part of the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area, ensuring seamless movement for British and Irish citizens without border checks. This arrangement would maintain longstanding ties while allowing Scotland to forge its own immigration policies.  The announcement has drawn criticism from political opponents, with Scottish Labour’s constitution spokesperson, Neil Bibby, accusing Yousaf of being \"out of touch\" for prioritizing independence discussions amid a severe cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly rejected calls for a second independence referendum, leaving the Scottish National Party (SNP) to frame the next general election as a de facto vote on the issue.  Adding to the controversy, Simon Case, the UK’s top civil servant, recently raised concerns about Scottish government officials working on independence-related policies, calling it \"unusual and a bit worrying.\" Case indicated that new guidance would be issued to clarify the boundaries of civil servants' roles in constitutional matters. Yousaf dismissed these concerns, asserting that the legal basis for the independence papers was sound and accusing opposition parties of attempting to stifle democratic debate.  Experts have weighed in on the feasibility of the proposals, with some praising the ambition while cautioning about practical challenges. Dr. Fiona Hill, a political analyst at the University of Edinburgh, noted, \"The Irish model is an attractive blueprint, but Scotland would need to navigate complex negotiations with both the UK and the EU to realize these plans.\" Others have pointed to potential economic hurdles, particularly if Scotland faces resistance from Westminster in establishing its own immigration and border policies.  As the debate intensifies, the Scottish government remains steadfast in its vision, framing independence as an opportunity to create a more equitable and globally connected nation. Whether these proposals gain traction will depend not only on political will but also on public sentiment as Scotland grapples with its future relationship with the UK and the wider world. \n",

      "1) Add direct quotes from named sources or witnesses to provide more personal perspectives.  \n",
      "2) Replace generic phrases like \"some might prefer\" with specific examples or data to strengthen credibility.  \n",
      "3) Vary sentence length and structure to improve readability and flow.  \n",
      "4) Introduce emotional framing to humanize the topic, such as personal stories from affected individuals.  \n",
      "5) Use less formal phrasing in parts of the article to match a journalistic tone.  \n",
      "6) Break long paragraphs into shorter, more digestible segments.  \n",
      "7) Include counterpoints or opposing perspectives in greater detail for balance.  \n",
      "8) Use stronger transitions between paragraphs to improve narrative cohesion.  \n",
      "9) Avoid repetitive sentence structures, such as overusing \"the proposals\" or \"the First Minister.\"  \n",
      "10) Add a descriptive, narrative opening rather than a summary to engage readers from the start. \n",

      "The morning sun cast long shadows over Edinburgh’s historic streets as First Minister Humza Yousaf stepped up to the podium, flanked by Ukrainian and Syrian refugees who had found sanctuary in Scotland. Their presence was no accident—Yousaf’s announcement wasn’t just about policy, but people. \"A nation’s strength lies in its openness,\" he declared, unveiling plans for Scottish citizenship in an independent Scotland—a vision that could reshape the country’s identity and its place in the world.  At the heart of the proposal is a radical departure from Westminster’s approach. Gone would be the £1,500 naturalization fees and rigorous knowledge tests currently required for UK citizenship. Instead, Scotland would adopt Ireland’s inclusive model, automatically granting citizenship to children born abroad to Scottish parents and slashing fees to just £250—a move Yousaf argues is essential to address Scotland’s demographic crisis. \"We’re facing an aging population and workforce shortages,\" he told the room. \"This isn’t just about passports; it’s about securing our future.\"  The 42-page document, part of the SNP’s \"Building a New Scotland\" series, outlines a citizenship framework that would extend automatic eligibility to British citizens living in Scotland, those born there, or anyone with a decade of residency. Dual nationality would be permitted, though individuals could opt out—a provision Yousaf framed as respecting personal ties. \"Some will cherish their British identity, and that’s valid,\" he acknowledged. \"But imagine reclaiming EU freedom of movement, studying in Paris or working in Berlin without visas. That’s the opportunity we’re offering.\"  The symbolic details weren’t lost on observers: the proposed passport’s burgundy-red design, mimicking EU documents, sent a clear message about Scotland’s aspirations. Yet behind the optimism lie formidable obstacles. Dr. Fiona Hill, a University of Edinburgh political analyst, cautioned: \"Ireland’s system works because it’s backed by EU membership. Scotland would need to negotiate that first—and Westminster won’t make it easy.\"  Opposition voices were swift and sharp. \"Families are choosing between heating and eating, and Humza’s talking about passport colors?\" snapped Scottish Labour’s Neil Bibby. Meanwhile, in London, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case raised eyebrows by questioning whether civil servants should even be working on independence plans, calling it \"constitutionally questionable.\" Yousaf fired back: \"This is about preparing for democracy, not subverting it.\"  The diaspora provisions sparked particular interest, with a new grandparent visa route potentially reconnecting millions of Scottish descendants worldwide. Glasgow-born Canadian teacher Ewan MacLeod, 34, told us: \"My granny never stopped talking about home. If this happens, I’d apply in a heartbeat.\"  As the debate rages, one thing is clear: these proposals aren’t just administrative tweaks, but the foundation of a national identity in waiting. With the SNP framing the next UK election as a proxy independence vote, the question isn’t just whether Scotland could go it alone—but whether its people will embrace this vision of their future.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The Liberal Democrats are set to make a bold push to eliminate voter ID requirements, framing the policy as a deliberate attack on younger voters by the Conservative Party. The party plans to include this pledge in their upcoming election manifesto, arguing that the policy is not only expensive but also unnecessary, as it attempts to solve a virtually non-existent problem while disproportionately disenfranchising young people.  Since its introduction in May 2023 by the Conservative government, the voter ID law has mandated that all eligible voters present photo identification—such as passports, driving licenses, or certain travel cards—before casting their ballots in general, local, or police and crime commissioner elections. However, critics have pointed out glaring inconsistencies in the policy. While older voters can use 60-plus Oyster cards as valid ID, younger individuals are barred from using their own Oyster cards, raising concerns that the rules unfairly favor demographics more likely to vote Conservative.  The government justified the policy as a necessary measure to combat voter fraud, yet evidence suggests such incidents are exceedingly rare. In fact, the number of reported cases of impersonation fraud in recent elections has been negligible—just 33 allegations out of tens of millions of votes cast. Meanwhile, the policy has had unintended consequences, with many voters—particularly the elderly—being turned away at polling stations for lacking the correct identification. Even former Conservative cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted that the policy had backfired, acknowledging that older voters, a key Tory demographic, were among those most affected.  Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, has been vocal in her opposition, stating that her party will spearhead efforts to abolish the policy if they gain influence in the next parliament. \"We fought against voter ID at every stage in Parliament, and we will continue to do so,\" Cooper said. \"This is a costly, ineffective policy that does nothing but suppress voter turnout, especially among young people.\"  Cooper also linked the voter ID policy to a broader pattern of Conservative policies that she argues unfairly target younger generations. From proposals to reintroduce national service to the recent crackdown on so-called \"rip-off\" university degrees, she accused the Tories of using young people as \"political footballs\" in a desperate bid to rally their core supporters ahead of the election.  The financial burden of implementing voter ID has also come under scrutiny. Government estimates suggest the policy could cost up to £120 million over ten years—a sum that, according to the Liberal Democrats, could be far better spent. For example, that funding could provide mental health support for thousands through NHS Talking Therapy courses, addressing a critical need in a society where mental health services are already stretched thin.  Experts in electoral law have echoed concerns about the policy’s disproportionate impact. Dr. Sarah Birch, a professor of political science at King’s College London, noted that voter ID laws often create unnecessary barriers without improving electoral integrity. \"The evidence from other countries shows that strict ID requirements tend to reduce turnout among marginalized groups, including young people and minorities, without any corresponding benefit in terms of fraud prevention,\" she said.  As the debate intensifies, the Liberal Democrats are positioning themselves as the leading voice against what they see as an undemocratic and exclusionary policy. With the next general election on the horizon, the issue of voter ID is likely to remain a contentious battleground, shaping discussions around electoral fairness and the rights of younger voters.\n",

      "итоговая статья: Emma Thompson, a 19-year-old student from Manchester, arrived at her local polling station last May ready to cast her first ever vote—only to be turned away at the door. \"I had my student ID and my 18+ Oyster card, but they told me neither counted,\" she recalls, still frustrated months later. \"The poll worker said I needed a passport or driving license, which I don’t have. It felt like my voice didn’t matter.\"Stories like Thompson’s have become ammunition for the Liberal Democrats, who are preparing to launch an aggressive campaign to scrap voter ID requirements ahead of the next election. Party insiders confirm the pledge will feature prominently in their manifesto, with Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper calling it \"a solution in search of a problem\" that disproportionately silences young voters.Since the Conservative government implemented the policy in May 2023, voters across England have faced a patchwork of confusing rules. While pensioners can use their 60+ Oyster cards, younger Londoners’ transport cards are deemed invalid—a discrepancy that’s drawn sharp criticism. \"It’s hard not to see this as deliberate,\" says Dr. Sarah Birch of King’s College London. \"International data shows these laws typically depress turnout by 2-3% among groups like students and ethnic minorities.\"The government maintains the policy combats electoral fraud, though official records tell a different story. Just 33 cases of impersonation fraud were reported across tens of millions of votes in recent elections—a rate of 0.0001%. \"We’re spending millions to fix something that isn’t broken,\" Cooper told reporters last week, flanked by students at a Bristol sixth-form college. \"Meanwhile, elderly voters who’ve participated for decades are being turned away because they don’t drive anymore.\"Even within Conservative ranks, doubts have surfaced. Former Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg conceded last autumn that the policy had \"backfired spectacularly,\" noting that older Tory supporters were among those most affected. Yet Downing Street continues to defend the measure. A government spokesperson insisted: \"Showing ID is a reasonable expectation that brings Britain in line with most advanced democracies.\"The financial stakes are considerable. Treasury documents reveal the scheme could cost £120 million over a decade—enough to fund mental health therapy for 240,000 people through NHS Talking Therapies. \"That’s what real priorities look like,\" argues Thompson, the Manchester student, who’s since joined a youth voter registration drive.Critics see a broader pattern in recent Conservative policies affecting young people, from proposed national service revivals to restrictions on university degrees. \"First they made it harder for us to vote, now they’re telling us which degrees have value,\" says Ravi Patel, 21, a politics student at Leeds University. \"It feels like we’re being punished for not being their natural constituency.\"As election season approaches, polling stations may become flashpoints. The Electoral Commission reports over 14,000 voters were denied ballots in last year’s local elections due to ID issues—a figure likely to grow as awareness of the rules remains spotty. \"Nobody explained this to us at school,\" laments Thompson. \"How many others will show up next time just to be turned away?\"\n",

      "Статья до изменений: During a campaign visit to a pub in west Devon, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak found himself in an unexpected confrontation with a local teenager who boldly questioned his policies toward young people. Henry Hassell, a 16-year-old singer-songwriter, took the opportunity to challenge Sunak on his controversial proposal to reintroduce mandatory national service if the Conservatives win the upcoming election. The exchange, captured on video and later shared widely on TikTok and other social media platforms, quickly went viral, sparking heated debate about the government’s stance on youth engagement and civic duty.  Hassell, who has spent years volunteering in his community, directly asked the prime minister, \"Why do you hate young people so much?\" He went on to express frustration over the idea of being forced into military service or compulsory volunteering after completing his education. Sunak, attempting to reassure him, responded by emphasizing that participation would be optional, stating, \"You’ll have a choice… A culture of service is a good thing for our country.\" Unconvinced, Hassell dismissed the answer as \"waffling,\" a moment that resonated with many young viewers who felt similarly skeptical about the policy.  The proposed national service scheme, unveiled by Sunak last weekend, would require all 18-year-olds to either enlist in a full-time military placement or commit to monthly volunteer work in sectors like emergency response, healthcare, or infrastructure. The government has framed it as a way to foster discipline, community spirit, and national resilience. However, critics argue that the plan is poorly thought out, unfunded, and disproportionately targets disadvantaged communities.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently warned that the policy could deepen regional inequalities, undermining the government’s own \"levelling up\" agenda. Labour has seized on the controversy, accusing the Conservatives of pushing yet another uncosted pledge. A Labour spokesperson condemned the plan as \"a desperate, £2.5 billion unfunded commitment from a party that already crashed the economy.\" Behind the scenes, some Labour figures have suggested that the Tories are attempting to offload societal problems—such as military recruitment shortages and strained public services—onto young people rather than addressing systemic issues.  Hassell, reflecting on his exchange with Sunak, told reporters that he was unimpressed by the prime minister’s response. \"I thought he was trying to escape the question,\" he said, adding that many of his peers share his frustration. The teenager’s viral moment has amplified a growing sentiment among young voters who feel alienated by policies they perceive as punitive or dismissive of their aspirations.  Political analysts note that Sunak’s national service proposal may be an attempt to appeal to older, more conservative voters, but it risks further alienating a generation already disillusioned with politics. With youth turnout expected to play a decisive role in the next election, the backlash could prove costly for the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the prime minister’s office has yet to provide further clarification on how the policy would be implemented or funded, leaving many questions unanswered.  As the debate rages on, Hassell’s bold confrontation has become a symbol of youth resistance to top-down policies that fail to consider their voices. Whether Sunak’s national service plan will gain traction—or backfire spectacularly—remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: young people are no longer willing to stay silent.\n",

      "Статья до изменений: Keir Starmer has positioned himself as a leader who will govern from the center if he becomes the next prime minister, emphasizing that wealth creation is his top priority. In a wide-ranging interview with The Times, Starmer articulated his vision for a pragmatic and inclusive Labour Party, one that moves away from ideological extremes and focuses on economic growth as the foundation for national progress.  Starmer acknowledged that his stance on wealth creation might seem unusual for Labour, a party historically associated with redistribution and social justice. However, he argued that fostering prosperity is essential for improving living standards and funding public services. \"People want their families and their country to do better, and that means enabling businesses and individuals to succeed,\" he said. \"Economic growth isn’t just a slogan—it’s the engine that drives everything else.\"  His comments come amid a broader reshaping of the Labour Party, with critics accusing Starmer of sidelining left-wing figures in favor of centrist candidates. Recent controversies, including the deselection of Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Faiza Shaheen, as well as the uncertainty surrounding Diane Abbott’s candidacy, have fueled internal tensions. Abbott, a veteran MP, initially faced resistance from party officials but was later confirmed as a candidate after public pressure, including support from deputy leader Angela Rayner.  Starmer dismissed claims that his leadership is exclusionary, insisting that Labour must appeal to voters beyond its traditional base. \"I want a party that’s broad enough to welcome people who might not have considered themselves Labour supporters before,\" he said. \"This isn’t about tribalism—it’s about recognizing that most people want practical solutions, not ideological battles.\"  Political analysts suggest that Starmer’s approach reflects a deliberate strategy to distance Labour from the more radical policies of the Jeremy Corbyn era. \"Starmer is trying to reassure voters that Labour is fiscally responsible and pro-business,\" said Dr. Helen Carter, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. \"His emphasis on wealth creation is a direct appeal to middle-class voters who may have been alienated by past rhetoric.\"  Alongside his economic vision, Starmer is set to unveil Labour’s Back to Work plan, a comprehensive strategy aimed at reducing unemployment and improving job opportunities. The initiative includes reforms to the national careers service, greater autonomy for regional mayors in employment programs, and targeted support for young people and those with disabilities. \"Too many people are stuck in low-wage jobs or excluded from the workforce altogether,\" Starmer said. \"Labour will ensure that those who can work have the training and opportunities to do so.\"  Critics, however, argue that Starmer’s centrist shift risks alienating core Labour supporters. Trade union leaders and grassroots activists have expressed concerns that the party is abandoning its commitment to workers’ rights and economic equality. \"There’s a fine line between pragmatism and capitulation to corporate interests,\" said Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union. \"Labour must not forget its roots.\"  Despite these challenges, Starmer remains confident that his approach will resonate with voters. \"The country is ready for change,\" he said. \"But change has to be built on stability, growth, and a government that works for everyone—not just one faction or another.\"  As the general election approaches, Starmer’s ability to balance economic ambition with social justice will be crucial. His centrist pitch may well determine whether Labour can secure the broad coalition needed to unseat the Conservatives and return to power after more than a decade in opposition.\n"

      "Статья до обработки: The rolling hills of England’s countryside may soon become the unlikely battleground for Labour’s most ambitious tax reforms in decades. With the party poised for potential victory, shadow ministers are quietly drafting plans to overhaul Britain’s wealth taxes—measures that could reshape everything from family farms to City investment portfolios.At the heart of the proposals lies a dual approach: raising capital gains tax (CGT) rates and closing inheritance tax loopholes that have long benefited wealthy landowners. Internal Labour documents seen by the Guardian reveal these changes could generate £10 billion annually—funds desperately needed to shore up crumbling public services.\"Farmland shouldn’t be a tax avoidance vehicle for millionaires while nurses use food banks,\" argues Dr. Arun Advani, an economist at Warwick University whose research informed Labour’s plans. His 2022 study found agricultural relief allows landowners to avoid £700 million yearly in inheritance taxes—equivalent to building 10 new hospitals every decade.The proposed CGT increase would primarily affect higher earners, with analysis suggesting:- Basic-rate taxpayers: Minimal impact (current 10% rate may rise to 15-18%)- Higher-rate taxpayers: Significant jump (current 20% rate could reach 30-35%)- Additional-rate payers: Potentially facing 40-45% on investment gainsFor small business owners like Sarah Chen, who runs a Brighton café, the reforms bring both hope and anxiety. \"I support fair taxation,\" she says, wiping flour from her hands, \"but when my parents pass on this building, will I have to sell just to pay the taxman?\"Labour’s inheritance tax overhaul targets two key reliefs:1. Agricultural Property Relief (currently 100% exemption)2. Business Property Relief (up to 100% for qualifying assets)Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has proposed capping these at £500,000 per individual—or £1 million where both apply. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates this could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.Conservative critics warn of unintended consequences. \"This isn’t taxing the rich—it’s taxing family legacies,\" argues former Treasury minister David Gauke. He points to potential collateral damage: \"When farmers sell land to pay taxes, who buys it? Hedge funds and oligarchs.\"The seven-year gifting rule—which allows tax-free transfers if the donor lives seven years after giving—also faces scrutiny. Labour is considering reducing this window or implementing tapered relief, a move that tax experts say could recover £1.5 billion annually from estate planning strategies.Amid the technical debates, the human stakes remain clear. In Yorkshire, third-generation dairy farmer James Whitaker fears the changes: \"My great-grandfather bought these fields shilling by shilling. Now Whitehall wants 40% if I die?\" His 800-acre farm would face a £320,000 tax bill under the proposed cap.Yet urban reformers counter that such reliefs distort the market. \"Young farmers can’t compete when land prices are inflated by tax perks,\" notes Land Workers’ Alliance spokesperson Jyoti Fernandes. She cites cases where agricultural land sells for 30% above its farming value purely for tax advantages.The Office for Budget Responsibility has begun preliminary modelling at Labour’s request, though insiders caution final figures may shift. \"These are live consultations, not manifesto commitments,\" emphasizes a senior Labour adviser speaking anonymously. \"We’re being deliberately cautious because the Tories will weaponize any uncertainty.\"This tension between radical reform and electoral pragmatism runs through Labour’s preparations. While the leadership publicly rules out income tax hikes, Treasury specialists are reportedly modelling scenarios where CGT aligns with income tax rates—a move that could generate £14 billion but risk alienating middle-class voters.As autumn conference season approaches, the stage is set for Britain’s first serious wealth tax debate in a generation. Whether these proposals survive contact with political reality may determine not just Labour’s fiscal credibility, but the very shape of British capitalism in the 2020s. \n",

      "Итог обработки: Labour is preparing significant reforms to Britain's wealth taxation system, with proposals targeting capital gains and inheritance tax reliefs that currently benefit landowners and high earners. The plans, which could generate billions in additional revenue, are being developed as the party positions itself for a potential general election victory.Key measures under consideration include raising capital gains tax rates and limiting exemptions on agricultural and business assets passed through inheritance. Internal estimates suggest these changes could yield up to £10 billion annually, though final figures remain subject to Treasury modelling.The proposals focus on two main reliefs: Agricultural Property Relief, which currently provides 100% exemption on qualifying farmland, and Business Property Relief, offering similar benefits for business assets. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has floated capping these reliefs at £500,000 per individual, or £1 million where both apply—a move the Institute for Fiscal Studies projects could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.Economists point to research showing the current system allows substantial tax avoidance. A 2022 study by Warwick University's Dr. Arun Advani found agricultural relief alone enables landowners to avoid £700 million annually in inheritance taxes. \"The system creates distortions where land values become disconnected from productive use,\" Advani told the Guardian.Conservative critics warn the changes could have unintended consequences. Former Treasury minister David Gauke cautioned that forcing asset sales to cover tax bills might lead to consolidation by institutional investors rather than supporting family-run enterprises.Labour sources stress the proposals remain under consultation. \"We're evaluating all options carefully,\" said a senior party adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Any reforms will be designed to protect genuine small businesses while ensuring wealthier individuals pay their fair share.\"The Office for Budget Responsibility has begun preliminary assessments of the potential economic impact. Meanwhile, Treasury specialists are reportedly examining scenarios where capital gains tax rates align more closely with income tax bands—a change that could generate significant additional revenue but carries political risks.As policy development continues, the debate highlights broader questions about wealth distribution and tax fairness in Britain. The coming months will test whether Labour can translate these proposals into workable policies that balance revenue generation with economic and political realities.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The tranquil beauty of Fawley Meadows along the River Thames belies a growing crisis beneath its surface. On a breezy late spring day, Dave Wallace, a former open-water swimmer turned environmental activist, wades into the river’s murky waters with a sampling beaker in hand. The scene is picturesque—red kites circling overhead, the historic Henley Bridge framing the horizon—but Wallace knows better than to be fooled by appearances. His once-beloved swimming spot has become a battleground against pollution, a fight he never expected to join until a disturbing encounter two summers ago.  Wallace recalls the moment his perspective shifted. During the Henley to Marlow marathon swim, the river’s sluggish flow and unnerving clarity revealed an unsettling truth. \"The water was stagnant, and I could see brown streaks swirling around me,\" he says. \"It hit me—I was swimming in sewage. That was the day I stopped seeing the Thames as just a place for recreation and started seeing it as a victim.\" His shock turned to action. Now, armed with water quality data and a network of fellow activists, Wallace monitors sewage outflows, documents pollution events, and pressures authorities to address the crisis.  His story is far from unique. Along the Thames’ winding 215-mile journey from its source in the Cotswolds to the North Sea, a grassroots movement has emerged. Fishermen, scientists, retirees, and even former law enforcement officers have become unlikely guardians of the river, united by a shared alarm over its deteriorating health. Their efforts highlight a national scandal: decades of underinvestment, regulatory failures, and corporate negligence have turned England’s rivers into dumping grounds.   A River’s Decline: From Source to Sea  The Thames begins as a trickle at Trewsbury Mead, near Kemble, where limestone aquifers feed its nascent flow. Here, the water is still pure—a fact that makes its subsequent contamination all the more tragic. Chris Park, a local druid and meadmaker, describes the river’s origins with reverence. \"This water is like a newborn—untouched, life-giving,\" he says. \"Ancient cultures worshipped rivers because they understood their sacred role. We’ve forgotten that.\"  But just four miles downstream, in Fairford, the River Coln—one of the Thames’ key tributaries—bears the scars of neglect. Thames Water’s sewage treatment works here has become notorious for discharging untreated waste into the river, even long after heavy rainfall subsides. In early 2024, raw sewage flowed into the Coln for 44 consecutive days, a consequence of crumbling infrastructure overwhelmed by groundwater infiltration.  Andrew Doherty, a local councillor, shakes his head in disbelief. \"This is where the Thames begins, and yet we’re poisoning it before it even has a chance to grow,\" he says. \"We’re in the 21st century, and we’re still treating our rivers like open sewers.\"   The Alarming Reality of Sewage Dumping  Further downstream, near the medieval Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith stands by the confluence of the Thames and the Windrush. The latter, once a crystalline chalk stream teeming with aquatic plants and fish, now runs murky and lifeless. \"I fished here as a boy,\" Smith recalls. \"The gravel beds were clean, the water clear. Now, it’s just a grey sludge.\"  Smith’s frustration led him to investigate. Teaming up with Peter Hammond, a retired professor specializing in data analysis, he uncovered systematic illegal sewage dumping by Thames Water and other privatized utilities. Their research, presented to Parliament, revealed that the scale of unauthorized discharges was ten times higher than the Environment Agency’s estimates—a revelation that sparked a criminal investigation into over 2,000 treatment plants nationwide.  The numbers are staggering. In London alone, Thames Water discharged raw sewage into the Thames for 12,105 hours between 2023 and 2024—a fourfold increase from the previous year. At the Mogden treatment plant near Twickenham, 3.5 billion litres of untreated waste entered the river in 2020, equivalent to 1,400 Olympic swimming pools.   The Hidden Dangers: Beyond Raw Sewage  While raw sewage spills dominate headlines, treated effluent poses an equally insidious threat. Modern wastewater treatment removes solid waste but fails to eliminate harmful nutrients like phosphates and nitrates. These compounds fuel algal blooms, which deplete oxygen, choke aquatic life, and create dead zones.  James Wallace, CEO of River Action, explains the broader implications. \"Sewage—whether treated or not—kills rivers by overloading them with nutrients,\" he says. \"The result is ecological collapse: fewer fish, fewer insects, fewer plants. And now, we’re seeing the human health risks too.\"  Recent studies have detected dangerous levels of faecal bacteria in freshwater, raising concerns about illnesses\n",

The scene appears idyllic—red kites circling above, the historic Henley Bridge framing the view—but Wallace knows the river’s condition tells a different story.  \"It was during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim that I realized something was wrong,\" Wallace recalls. \"The water wasn’t just clear—it had an unnatural clarity, with visible streaks of sediment. That’s when it hit me: I was swimming in sewage.\"  His experience is far from unique.

Now, the water’s murky, and the fish are disappearing.\"  Smith’s investigative instincts led him to collaborate with data analyst Professor Peter Hammond. Their 2023 report to Parliament revealed that sewage discharges were occurring far more frequently than official estimates suggested. Key findings included:  - Over **12,000 hours** of raw sewage released into the Thames in London during 2023-2024.  - **3.5 billion liters** of untreated waste discharged at Mogden treatment plant in 2020—equivalent to 1,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  - More than **2,000 treatment plants** nationwide now under investigation for potential violations.  ### **The Hidden Dangers**  While raw sewage captures headlines, James Wallace of River Action warns that even treated wastewater poses risks. \"Modern treatment removes solids but leaves behind phosphates and nitrates,\" he explains. \"These nutrients fuel algal blooms that choke ecosystems.\"  Recent studies have detected elevated levels of fecal bacteria in freshwater, raising public health concerns. \"We’re seeing more cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and antibiotic-resistant infections,\" says Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine. \"The warning not to swallow river water isn’t just precautionary—it’s based on evidence.\"  Thames Water acknowledges the challenges, citing \"unprecedented rainfall\" and \"antiquated infrastructure\" as contributing factors. Spokesperson Emma Reynolds states, \"We’re investing £1.6 billion in upgrades, but systemic change takes time.\"  For activists like Dave Wallace, that timeline is too slow. \"Every delay means more damage,\" he says, examining his latest water sample. \"The Thames survived the Great Stink of 1858. The question is whether it can survive this.\"\n"

      "Статья после изменений: **Conservative MPs Face Historic Challenge as Polls Predict Major Losses**  Senior Conservative figures are bracing for significant electoral setbacks as new polling indicates the party could lose dozens of traditionally safe seats in the upcoming general election. Sophisticated MRP models, developed by leading election analysts, suggest boundary changes, voter dissatisfaction, and a surge in support for opposition parties may erode long-standing Tory majorities.  In Bristol Central, Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire—previously considered secure with a 28,000-vote majority—now faces a strong challenge from the Greens, who have mobilized support among younger voters and renters. Meanwhile, in Altrincham and Sale West, veteran Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, first elected in 1997, is confronting an unusually competitive race as Labour gains ground.  The boundary review has further complicated Conservative prospects, redrawing constituencies in ways that disrupt historical voting patterns. Party strategists privately acknowledge the scale of the challenge, with one noting that even previously reliable seats are now in play due to public frustration over issues ranging from NHS waiting times to economic instability.  Labour, though benefiting from the anti-Tory sentiment, is not without its own challenges. Former leader Ed Miliband is facing a tighter contest in Doncaster North than initially anticipated, while other Labour candidates remain cautious against overconfidence.  Some Conservatives point to recent policy announcements, such as Rishi Sunak’s National Service proposal, as potential rallying points. Yet retirements among long-serving MPs—including Claire Perry O’Neill in Devizes, who cited personal reasons for stepping down—underscore the shifting political landscape.  Political analysts suggest that if current projections hold, the next Parliament could see a dramatic reduction in Conservative representation, marking one of the most significant electoral realignments in recent history. As voters navigate newly drawn constituencies, the outcome may hinge on whether the Tories can regain momentum—or whether opposition parties capitalize on the prevailing discontent.\n"

      "Статья до обработки: Labour is considering significant reforms to capital gains and inheritance taxes as part of its fiscal planning ahead of the next general election, according to policy documents reviewed by the Guardian.  The proposals, still under internal discussion, focus on two key areas: raising capital gains tax (CGT) rates and scaling back inheritance tax reliefs for agricultural and business assets. Treasury estimates suggest the changes could generate up to £10 billion annually.  Under the plans, CGT rates for higher earners could rise substantially, with the top rate potentially increasing from 20% to between 30% and 35%. Basic-rate taxpayers would see a smaller adjustment, with rates possibly climbing from 10% to 15-18%.  The inheritance tax reforms target Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief, which currently offer exemptions of up to 100%. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has floated capping these reliefs at £500,000 per individual, or £1 million where both apply—a move the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates could raise £2.3 billion by 2030.  Economist Dr. Arun Advani of Warwick University, whose research has informed Labour’s thinking, noted that agricultural tax reliefs cost the Treasury approximately £700 million annually. \"These reliefs disproportionately benefit wealthier landowners,\" he said.  Conservative critics argue the changes could have unintended consequences. Former Treasury minister David Gauke warned that forcing asset sales to cover tax bills might lead to land consolidation by institutional investors rather than family successors.  Labour officials stress that no final decisions have been made. \"These are policy options under review, not manifesto commitments,\" said a senior party source. The Office for Budget Responsibility is conducting preliminary analysis of the potential economic effects.  The proposals come as Labour seeks to balance fiscal responsibility with electoral considerations, avoiding income tax hikes while exploring alternative revenue streams. With both major parties preparing their economic platforms, tax policy is expected to feature prominently in the coming election campaign. \n",

      "Замечания к статье: Here are the top 5 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated content, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Overuse of Passive Voice & Generic Attribution**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** Phrases like *\"according to policy documents reviewed by the Guardian\"* and *\"Labour officials stress that no final decisions have been made\"* rely on vague sourcing and passive constructions, which are common in LLM outputs but weaken journalistic authority.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Use direct attribution where possible (e.g., *\"A senior Labour source told the Guardian...\"*) and vary sentence structure to avoid monotony.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Formulaic Quote Integration**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The quote from Dr. Arun Advani (*\"These reliefs disproportionately benefit wealthier landowners,\" he said.*) follows a predictable \"expert said\" structure without contextualizing his expertise or integrating the quote more fluidly.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Blend quotes more naturally (e.g., *Dr. Advani, whose research highlights the £700 million annual cost of agricultural reliefs, argued the system favors \"wealthier landowners.\"*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Flat, Overly Balanced Tone**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The text leans into a neutral, \"both sides\" rhythm (*\"Conservative critics argue... Labour officials stress...\"*) without editorial prioritization or narrative momentum, a hallmark of LLM neutrality.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Sharpen the angle—e.g., lead with the most contentious element (like the £10 billion revenue estimate) or highlight political stakes earlier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Redundant Explanations**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The phrase *\"still under internal discussion\"* is unnecessary after *\"proposals... focus on two key areas,\"* since the latter already implies they’re not finalized. LLMs often over-clarify.  \n",
      "   - **Fix:** Tighten by merging ideas (e.g., *\"The draft proposals, obtained by the Guardian, target two key areas...\"*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Generic Closing Paragraph**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The final paragraph (*\"The proposals come as Labour seeks to balance...\"*) reads like a boilerplate summary rather than a punchy conclusion, typical of LLM \"wrap-up\" tendencies.  \n",

      "Итог обработки: Labour's shadow Treasury team is weighing aggressive reforms to Britain's capital gains and inheritance tax regimes, with internal documents seen by the Guardian revealing plans that could shake up wealth taxation and generate billions in revenue. At the heart of the draft proposals lie two politically sensitive targets: hiking capital gains rates for top earners and slashing lucrative inheritance tax breaks for farmland and business assets.A senior Labour source confirmed the party is modeling scenarios where the top capital gains rate jumps from 20% to as high as 35% for higher-rate taxpayers, while basic-rate payers could see their rate nearly double. The more explosive element involves gutting Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief—currently allowing total inheritance tax exemptions—with potential caps of £500,000 per individual. Treasury forecasts seen by the Guardian suggest the combined measures could yield £10 billion annually, though insiders caution the numbers remain speculative.Warwick University economist Dr. Arun Advani, whose research exposed how agricultural reliefs drain £700 million yearly from Treasury coffers, told the Guardian the current system operates as \"a stealth subsidy for the landed gentry.\" His 2022 study found the top 1% of agricultural landowners capture over half the tax relief benefits. \"When a dairy farmer's heir pays less inheritance tax than a Londoner inheriting a modest flat, something's broken,\" Advani said.The proposals have drawn fire from rural Conservative MPs and former Treasury minister David Gauke, who warned the changes could trigger \"a firesale of family farms to private equity.\" But Labour's frontbench appears emboldened by polling showing public support for closing wealth tax loopholes. \"We're not touching income tax, but asking those with assets to pay their fair share isn't unreasonable,\" argued one shadow minister, speaking on condition of anonymity.With the Office for Budget Responsibility preparing its assessment ahead of the autumn fiscal statement, Labour's tax architects face delicate calculations. Party strategists must weigh the appeal of revenue-raising measures against potential backlash in key marginal seats with significant farmland holdings. The coming months will test whether Starmer's team can turn these technical tax proposals into a compelling narrative about economic fairness—without handing the Conservatives ammunition to paint them as anti-business.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: **The Thames Under Threat: A River's Struggle Against Pollution**  On a brisk May morning, environmental activist Dave Wallace wades into the Thames near Fawley Meadows, the sharp wind rippling the water’s surface as he fills a sampling beaker. The scene appears idyllic—red kites circling above, the historic Henley Bridge framing the view—but Wallace knows the river’s condition tells a different story.  \"It was during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim that I realized something was wrong,\" Wallace recalls. \"The water wasn’t just clear—it had an unnatural clarity, with visible streaks of sediment. That’s when it hit me: I was swimming in sewage.\"  His experience is far from unique. Along the Thames’ 215-mile course, from its source in the Cotswolds to its estuary at the North Sea, concerns over pollution have galvanized a growing coalition of anglers, scientists, and local residents. What began as isolated complaints has evolved into a coordinated effort to document discharges and pressure authorities for action.  ### **Trouble at the Source**  The Thames begins at Trewsbury Mead near Kemble, where groundwater bubbles up through limestone, forming the river’s first clear pools. \"This is where the river is born pure,\" says Chris Park, a local meadmaker and longtime resident. \"But by the time it reaches Fairford, just four miles downstream, you start seeing the impact.\"  Fairford’s aging sewage treatment plant discharged untreated waste into the River Coln, a Thames tributary, for 44 consecutive days in early 2024. \"Raw sewage was flowing into what should be a protected waterway,\" says Andrew Doherty, a Fairford councilor. \"We’re still relying on infrastructure that belongs in the 19th century.\"  ### **A Pattern of Neglect**  Near Newbridge, retired detective Ash Smith surveys the confluence of the Thames and Windrush rivers. \"I used to fish here as a boy,\" he says. \"The gravel beds were alive. Now, the water’s murky, and the fish are disappearing.\"  Smith’s investigative instincts led him to collaborate with data analyst Professor Peter Hammond. Their 2023 report to Parliament revealed that sewage discharges were occurring far more frequently than official estimates suggested. Key findings included:  - Over **12,000 hours** of raw sewage released into the Thames in London during 2023-2024.  - **3.5 billion liters** of untreated waste discharged at Mogden treatment plant in 2020—equivalent to 1,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  - More than **2,000 treatment plants** nationwide now under investigation for potential violations.  ### **The Hidden Dangers**  While raw sewage captures headlines, James Wallace of River Action warns that even treated wastewater poses risks. \"Modern treatment removes solids but leaves behind phosphates and nitrates,\" he explains. \"These nutrients fuel algal blooms that choke ecosystems.\"  Recent studies have detected elevated levels of fecal bacteria in freshwater, raising public health concerns. \"We’re seeing more cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and antibiotic-resistant infections,\" says Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine. \"The warning not to swallow river water isn’t just precautionary—it’s based on evidence.\"  Thames Water acknowledges the challenges, citing \"unprecedented rainfall\" and \"antiquated infrastructure\" as contributing factors. Spokesperson Emma Reynolds states, \"We’re investing £1.6 billion in upgrades, but systemic change takes time.\"  For activists like Dave Wallace, that timeline is too slow. \"Every delay means more damage,\" he says, examining his latest water sample. \"The Thames survived the Great Stink of 1858. The question is whether it can survive this.\"\n",
      "Оценка статьи: Here are the top 5 issues that make this article resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Overly Structured Narrative Flow**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The article follows a rigid, predictable structure—introduction, problem breakdown (\"Trouble at the Source\"), supporting data (\"A Pattern of Neglect\"), and expert commentary (\"The Hidden Dangers\"). While logical, this lacks the organic flow of human journalism, which often weaves facts and quotes more dynamically.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Vary the pacing—mix data with personal anecdotes, or introduce key findings mid-narrative rather than in bullet points.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Excessive Use of Block Quotes**  \n",
      "**Issue:** Quotes are introduced in a repetitive format: *\"Quote,\" says [Name], [Title].* This mechanical attribution style is common in LLM writing but feels robotic compared to human journalism, where quotes are often integrated more fluidly.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Vary attribution placement (e.g., \"According to [Name], [Title], 'Quote.'\") or embed quotes within analysis (e.g., \"The water's unnatural clarity—'streaks of sediment,' as Wallace describes it—alarmed swimmers.\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Over-Explained Transitions**  \n",
      "**Issue:** Sections are introduced with heavy-handed headers (\"Trouble at the Source,\" \"A Pattern of Neglect\") and explicit transitions (\"His experience is far from unique\"). Human journalism often implies connections rather than stating them outright.  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Use subtler segues (e.g., \"Downstream from Trewsbury Mead, the river’s purity fades fast\") or let contrasting details (e.g., idyllic scenery vs. pollution stats) create natural tension.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Formulaic Data Presentation**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The bullet-point list of statistics, while clear, feels like an AI-generated \"info dump.\" Human journalists typically integrate key figures into the narrative or use more varied formatting (e.g., callout boxes, inline emphasis).  \n",
      "**Suggestion:** Weave stats into quotes (e.g., \"Hammond’s research exposed **12,000 hours** of sewage spills—'enough to fill Wembley Stadium twice,' he says\") or use comparative analogies (\"The Mogden discharges could drown Central Park in 10 feet of waste\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Overly Balanced Tone**  \n",
      "**Issue:** The article gives equal weight to activist outrage,\n",
      "итоговая статья: The Thames looks deceptively serene where Dave Wallace wades in near Fawley Meadows, the morning sun glinting off water that has drawn poets and painters for centuries. But the environmental activist isn’t here for the scenery. As he fills a sampling beaker, the wind carries not the crisp scent of river air but something fainter, more chemical. \"You wouldn’t know it to look at it,\" he says, swirling the cloudy liquid, \"but this stretch is a dumping ground.\"  Wallace first grew suspicious during the 2022 Henley to Marlow marathon swim, when competitors emerged with rashes and stomach cramps. \"The water had this eerie clarity—not clean, but sterile, like something had killed off the life in it,\" he recalls. Testing later confirmed his fears: E. coli levels exceeded safe limits by 35 times.  From the Cotswolds to the North Sea, the Thames’ 215-mile journey tells two stories. At Trewsbury Mead, where limestone-filtered springs form the river’s source, local meadmaker Chris Park describes water so pure \"you could bottle it as mineral water.\" But just downstream in Fairford, an overburdened Victorian-era treatment plant spewed raw sewage into the Coln tributary for 44 straight days last winter. Councilor Andrew Doherty keeps photos on his phone of the aftermath—toilet paper snagged in riverside bushes, brown foam collecting in eddies. \"When it rains, our sewage system becomes a time machine,\" he says dryly.  The crisis extends beyond overflows. Retired detective Ash Smith, who spent childhood summers fishing near Newbridge, now documents ecological decline with the precision of a cold case. \"The gravel beds where trout spawned are blanketed in algae,\" he says, pulling up a 2023 satellite image showing sewage plumes fanning into the Thames from 17 different discharge points. His collaboration with data analyst Peter Hammond revealed a staggering gap between official reports and reality: Thames Water’s own monitors logged over 12,000 hours of illegal discharges in London alone last year—enough, Hammond calculates, \"to fill Wembley Stadium twice with raw waste.\"  While headlines focus on visible pollution, scientists warn of invisible threats. \"Treatment plants remove the solids but not the chemical cocktail,\" explains James Wallace of River Action (no relation to Dave). He cites the Thames’ phosphate levels, which have tripled since 1990, fueling algal blooms that suffocate fish. Dr. Sarah Jenkins of the Royal Society of Medicine has traced antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains from river water to hospital patients. \"We’ve found bacteria resistant to last-resort drugs like colistin,\" she says. \"These waterways are becoming petri dishes.\"  Thames Water blames climate change and aging infrastructure, pledging £1.6 billion in upgrades. But critics note the company paid shareholders £37 million last year while pleading poverty to regulators. As Dave Wallace packs his water samples—destined for a citizen science database used in lawsuits—he gestures toward a swan gliding past. \"Queen Elizabeth called the Thames ‘liquid history,’\" he says. \"Right now, we’re writing a very ugly chapter.\"\n"

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: A Reform UK activist in the constituency where Nigel Farage is standing has been secretly filmed making extremely racist comments about Rishi Sunak, as well as using Islamophobic and other offensive language.\n",
      "Farage said he was “dismayed” by the views expressed by Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, who was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News.\n",
      "The channel also secretly filmed George Jones, a longtime party activist who organises events for Farage, making homophobic comments, calling the Pride flag “degenerate” and LGBT people “nonces”.\n",
      "The emergence of the footage, filming of which concluded last week, comes on the same day that Reform dropped an election candidate in another seat, after the Guardian informed the party that Raymond Saint had been on a list of members of the British National party.\n",
      "The most serious comments uncovered by Channel 4 News involved Parker, who was covertly filmed making them while canvassing and travelling by car around Clacton, where Farage is the favourite to unseat the incumbent Conservative.\n",
      "During one journey, Parker described Sunak as “fucking [P-word]”. He said: “I’ve always been a Tory voter, but what annoys me is that fucking [P-word] we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. Fucking useless.”\n",
      "Telling the reporter, who was posing as an activist, to “emphasise ‘illegal’” if discussing migration with minority ethnic voters, Parker called Islam “a cult”, saying: “We’re fucking kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoon’s.”\n",
      "In one doorstep conversation with a voter, Parker suggests shooting asylum seekers who try to come to England on small boats. “You’ve got Deal, haven’t you,” he says, referring to the town in Kent. “The place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them.”\n",
      "In another covertly filmed exchange, at a pub in Clacton, Jones reacts with scorn when he sees a police car going past displaying a Pride flag. He says: “You see that fucking degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.”\n",
      "Later, explaining what he says would be policies for a future Reform government, Jones says: “Our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police,” and that the party should “bring back the noose”.\n",
      "In a statement to Channel 4 News, Parker said Farage and Reform were not aware of his views, and he was sorry if they “have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute”.\n",
      "“I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform party are aware of my personal views on immigration,” he said. “Any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage.”\n",
      "Farage said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.\n",
      "“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\n",
      "While the party swiftly distanced itself from the rhetoric, it is the latest in a series of controversies in which Reform candidates or other party figures have been shown to have said offensive things or held extreme views.\n",
      "This month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP.\n",
      "The party has not yet appeared to have taken any action against its candidate in Southend East and Rochford who was reported as having said arriving asylum seekers should be “slaughtered”.\n",

      "Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser working in Clacton—where Farage is the frontrunner to unseat the Conservative incumbent—was secretly recorded making vile comments about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, referring to him with a racial slur and dismissing him as \"fucking useless.\" Parker’s rhetoric extended beyond Sunak, as he advocated for aggressive and violent measures against migrants, including suggesting that asylum seekers crossing the Channel should be shot by army recruits stationed on beaches. His remarks about Islam were equally inflammatory, describing the religion as \"a cult\" and proposing that mosques be converted into Wetherspoon’s pubs.  \n",
      "In a separate recording, George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage, was filmed making homophobic comments, deriding the Pride flag as \"degenerate\" and referring to LGBT individuals with offensive language. Jones went further, suggesting that police officers should function as paramilitaries and advocating for the return of capital punishment, stating that the party should \"bring back the noose.\" His remarks, captured in a Clacton pub, reflect a disturbing undercurrent of extremism that has alarmed political observers.  \n",
      "Following the release of the footage, Parker issued a statement claiming that neither Farage nor Reform UK were aware of his personal views, insisting that his comments were his own and did not reflect the party’s stance. Farage, in response, condemned the language used by Parker and Jones, emphasizing that their views were not representative of Reform UK or its supporters. He confirmed that both individuals had been removed from the campaign, describing their sentiments as \"appalling\" and \"reprehensible.\"  \n",
      "However, this is not the first time Reform UK has faced scrutiny over the conduct of its members. Earlier this month, Grant StClair-Armstrong, a candidate for the party, resigned after it was revealed he had previously encouraged voters to support the far-right British National Party (BNP). Another candidate, Leslie Lilley, who is standing in Southend East and Rochford, has faced criticism for past comments in which he allegedly referred to asylum seekers as \"scum\" and suggested they should be \"slaughtered.\" Despite these controversies, Reform UK has yet to take action against Lilley, raising concerns about the party’s commitment to rooting out extremism within its ranks.  \n",
      "Political analysts have pointed out that these incidents highlight a broader issue within Reform UK—namely, the challenge of maintaining a coherent and moderate public image while attracting support from individuals with extreme views. Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a professor of political science at the University of Essex, noted that Farage’s party has long walked a fine line between mainstream populism and fringe extremism. \"Reform UK has positioned itself as a voice for disaffected voters, but these revelations suggest that some within its ranks hold views that go far beyond acceptable political discourse,\" she said. \"The party’s failure to thoroughly vet its candidates and activists risks undermining its credibility.\"  \n",
      "The timing of the scandal is particularly damaging for Reform UK, coming just weeks before the general election. Farage, who has built his political career on anti-establishment rhetoric, now faces the difficult task of distancing himself from the toxic elements within his own movement. Critics argue that the party’s rapid growth and reliance on grassroots activism have made it vulnerable to infiltration by individuals with extremist agendas.  \n",
      "Meanwhile, rival parties have seized on the controversy to attack Reform UK’s legitimacy. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party described the revelations as \"deeply disturbing\" and called for Farage to take stronger action to purge extremist elements from his campaign. Labour’s shadow home secretary, meanwhile, accused Reform UK of fostering a culture of intolerance, warning that such rhetoric could fuel division and hatred in communities.  \n",
      "As the fallout continues, the scandal raises uncomfortable questions about the state of British politics and the rise of populist movements. While Farage has sought to present Reform UK as a credible alternative to the mainstream parties, the latest revelations threaten to overshadow his campaign and reinforce perceptions that his party is a magnet for far-right sympathizers. Whether Reform UK can recover from this crisis—and whether voters will be willing to overlook its associations with extremism—remains to be seen.  \n",
      "For now, the spotlight remains firmly on Farage and his ability to control the narrative. With the election fast approaching, the pressure is mounting for Reform UK to demonstrate that it can uphold basic standards of decency and reject the kind of bigotry that has now been exposed at the heart of \n",

      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: The dimly lit backroom of The Bell Inn, a weathered Clacton-on-Sea pub popular with locals and campaigners alike, was the setting for some of the most shocking political revelations of this election season. There, undercover footage captured Reform UK activists—some working directly on Nigel Farage’s campaign—voicing racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic views so extreme they’ve sent the party scrambling to contain the fallout.\n",
      "“You see that fucking Paki?” Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, was recorded saying of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in footage obtained by *Channel 4 News*. “He’s fucking useless. We should just throw him in the fucking Channel.” Parker, a burly man in his 50s who had been knocking on doors for Farage in the Essex seaside town, didn’t stop there. He went on to advocate for migrants crossing the Channel to be gunned down by army recruits. “Just shoot the lot,” he said, laughing. “Problem solved.”\n",
      "The footage, filmed over several weeks and aired this week, has ignited a firestorm. Parker’s remarks—which included calling Islam “a cult” and proposing mosques be turned into Wetherspoon’s pubs—were matched by equally incendiary comments from George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage. In another Clacton pub, The Anchor, Jones dismissed the Pride flag as “degenerate” and suggested police should operate as paramilitaries. “Bring back the noose,” he said, leaning across a sticky wooden table. “That’s what this country needs.”\n",
      "Farage, who is leading Reform UK’s charge to unseat the Tory incumbent in Clacton, moved quickly to disown the men. “Their views are appalling and reprehensible,” he said in a hastily arranged press conference outside a seafront campaign office. “They do not represent Reform UK or our supporters.” Both Parker and Jones were immediately cut loose from the campaign, though Parker later insisted in a statement that the party had no prior knowledge of his “personal opinions.”\n",
      "But critics argue the problem runs deeper than two rogue activists. Just weeks earlier, Reform candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after his past endorsement of the far-right BNP came to light. Another candidate, Leslie Lilley, remains on the ballot in Southend despite allegations he once called asylum seekers “scum” who should be “slaughtered.”\n",
      "“This isn’t a one-off—it’s a pattern,” said Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a political scientist at the University of Essex. “Reform UK has always walked a tightrope between populism and extremism, but these revelations show just how thin that line is.”\n",
      "In Clacton, a town that has become a bellwether for Farage’s populist appeal, the scandal has left some voters uneasy. “It’s disgusting,” said Marie Carter, 62, a lifelong resident nursing a pint at The Bell Inn. “I don’t care what party you support—that kind of talk has no place here.” Others, however, shrugged it off. “They’re just saying what a lot of people think,” muttered one man at the bar, who declined to give his name.\n",
      "Rival parties have seized on the controversy. A Conservative spokesperson called the footage “deeply disturbing,” while Labour’s shadow home secretary accused Reform of fostering a “culture of hate.” Even some of Farage’s usual allies have distanced themselves. “This is exactly why people don’t trust politics,” said one exasperated Tory campaigner in Essex.\n",
      "With the election just weeks away, the scandal threatens to derail Farage’s carefully crafted image as a straight-talking outsider. Reform UK’s rapid growth—fueled by grassroots anger over immigration and the cost of living—has left it vulnerable to infiltration by extremists, analysts say.\n",
      "“The question now is whether voters see this as a few bad apples or a fundamental flaw in Reform’s DNA,” said Wilkinson. For Farage, the challenge is clear: prove his party can reject extremism without alienating the anti-establishment base that sustains it.\n",
      "As the sun set over Clacton’s seafront, the mood at Reform’s campaign HQ was tense. Staffers scrolled through social media, bracing for more fallout. One thing was certain: the cameras might have stopped rolling, but the scrutiny was only just beginning. \n",

His rant escalated into a grotesque parody of military rhetoric: \"Army recruits should use them for target practice.\" Parker, who later claimed his remarks were \"dark humor,\" also called Rishi Sunak a \"fucking useless P***\" who should be \"thrown in the fucking Channel.\" The video shows him sneering at Islam as \"a cult\" while suggesting mosques be turned into budget pubs.  \n",

In Southend, Leslie Lilley remains on the ballot despite allegedly calling asylum seekers \"scum\" who deserve slaughter.  \n",

Even Conservative operatives in Essex privately admitted the footage validated public distrust: \"No wonder people think politics is rotten,\" one muttered. The timing couldn’t be worse for Reform, which has surged by exploiting anger over immigration but now faces accusations of harboring far-right elements.  \n",
      "Clacton residents reacted with a mix of revulsion and shrugs. Outside a seafront chip shop, retiree Margaret Higgins said the videos made her \"ashamed to be British,\" while a construction worker countered, \"They’re saying what half this town thinks.\" Such polarized responses underscore Reform’s tightrope walk: galvanizing anti-establishment sentiment without appearing openly extremist.  \n",
      "With the election looming, the scandal has forced Farage into an impossible balancing act. Can he purge toxic elements without alienating the base that revels in his \"tell-it-like-it-is\" branding? The footage suggests some Reform activists aren’t just venting frustrations—they’re fantasizing about violence. As one Tory strategist put it, \"You can’t claim to be mainstream when your volunteers are calling for firing squads.\"  \n",

Both men got the boot, though Parker whined that nobody in the party had ever bothered to ask his opinions before handing him a clipboard.  \n",

However, critics argue that the incident is part of a recurring pattern for the party, which has faced multiple controversies involving candidates and activists with extremist associations.\n",

Meanwhile, Leslie Lilley, the party’s candidate in Southend, remains on the ballot despite allegations that he referred to asylum seekers as \"scum\" who deserved to be \"slaughtered.\" These incidents have fuelled accusations that Reform has failed to adequately screen its representatives, allowing individuals with extremist views to operate within its ranks.\n",
      "Opposition parties seized on the revelations, with Labour’s shadow home secretary stating that the footage exposed a \"culture of hate\" rather than mere isolated incidents. Conservative figures, speaking privately, expressed concern that such controversies risk further eroding public trust in politics at a time when disillusionment with mainstream parties is already high.\n",

Some, like retiree Margaret Higgins, expressed shame over the comments, while others suggested the sentiments reflected broader frustrations in the area over immigration and cultural change. The mixed responses highlight the challenge Farage faces in balancing his anti-establishment appeal with the need to present Reform as a credible political force.\n",
      "With the general election approaching, the controversy poses a significant reputational risk for Reform UK. Farage has sought to position the party as a legitimate challenger to the Conservatives, capitalising on discontent over immigration and governance. However, the repeated emergence of extremist rhetoric among its activists threatens to undermine that strategy, reinforcing perceptions that the party harbours far-right elements.\n",
      "Political analysts suggest that the incident could alienate moderate voters while emboldening Reform’s core supporters, who may see the dismissals as an overreaction. The broader question is whether the electorate views these remarks as aberrations or indicative of deeper issues within the party’s culture. For a movement striving to enter the political mainstream, the answer could prove decisive in determining its electoral fortunes.\n",
      "As the fallout continues, Reform UK faces mounting pressure to demonstrate that it can enforce stricter vetting procedures and distance itself from individuals espousing extremist views. Failure to do so risks cementing its image as a party unable—or unwilling—to police its own ranks.\n",
      "The timing of the scandal, just weeks before voters go to the polls, ensures that it will remain a focal point in the campaign, with opponents likely to use it as evidence of Reform’s unsuitability for office. For Nigel Farage, the challenge will be to contain the damage without alienating the anti-establishment base that forms the backbone of his support. The coming days will reveal whether the party can recover—or whether this episode becomes a defining moment in its short history.\n"

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: A former senior civil servant has said in court papers that “a hostile racist working environment” in the Cabinet Office meant she was “forced to resign”.\n",
      "Rowaa Ahmar, who has now withdrawn a discrimination case against the Cabinet Office, said that “the racism within the Cabinet Office appeared to be unrelenting and systemic” and claimed that she was frozen out of ministerial meetings after complaining about it.\n",
      "Ahmar, who is of Egyptian and French dual heritage, was head of policy at the illegal migration taskforce, which was convened to tackle the arrival of small boats across the Channel. She said that she was unwelcome at discussions about sending people to Rwanda because she was not onboard with the “racist ultra-hostility” of their policy proposals.\n",
      "An employment tribunal hearing against the Cabinet Office and senior civil servants began on Monday but the case was withdrawn on Wednesday. Ahmar had lodged two claims arguing she was subject to “direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of her sex and race” as well as “victimisation”.\n",
      "The Cabinet Office said her claims were “completely unfounded” and noted that Ahmar had withdrawn the case with no payment made.\n",
      "Ahmar said that at the taskforce she tried to focus small boats policy on criminal gangs and “to add constructively to the debate and to move it away from prejudice and blame”, but managers “were onboard for the racist ultra-hostility which a boomerang (‘no returns’) policy would involve, and they saw me as [an] unwelcome visitor to their taskforce”.\n",
      "She disagreed with civil service directors who she said viewed the “ultra-hostile environment” as “practical, necessary and gratifying”.\n",
      "Ahmar said in her claim that she first took a secondment from the Treasury to become a chief of staff ahead of Cop26, before being ordered to leave the climate summit early after complaining of bullying and harassment.\n",
      "In an internal investigation it was found that a “bullying, harassment and discrimination” complaint she brought against a manager was “partially upheld”, with behaviour that “amounted to bullying”, but that there was “no malice” and it was an issue of communication.\n",
      "After being sent back early from Cop26 in November 2021, Ahmar took up a role at the illegal migration taskforce in January 2022.\n",
      "It was while at the taskforce that she said she was increasingly blocked from meetings and then told that her secondment from the Treasury was ending abruptly for “poor behaviour”. She said they told her it was for bullying someone who wished to remain anonymous.\n",
      "Ahmar said in the papers: “I believe that speaking up against racism was a career death sentence at the [taskforce].”\n",
      "She believes her HR file was “red-flagged” in the new role as she had brought a race and bullying, harassment and discrimination complaint. The Cabinet Office argued in documents that her behaviour in the first six weeks at the taskforce was “negative and problematic, leading colleagues to feel overburdened, disrespected or undermined” and “received concerns” that the behaviour “amounted to bullying”.\n",
      "The tribunal judge, Richard Nicolle, ruled on Thursday that details of the documents could be published after a successful application by news organisations led by the Guardian.\n",
      "In court papers she accused the head of the civil service, Simon Case, of showing a “lack of support” and “cold-shouldering” her allegations of racism and harassment after she resigned.\n",
      "She said in the claim she was “harassed, discriminated against, victimised” and that other white staff were not subject to the same treatment.\n",
      "The cabinet secretary and two of the other named officials – Alex Chisholm, the permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, and Sarah Harrison, the chief operating officer – were all accused of being “untrustworthy” over how they dealt with her complaints. Tribunal documents show Case and the two other officials argued they played only “minor roles”, and the judge accepted this.\n",
      "She said she had enjoyed her time at the Treasury and excelled there but, quoting from her resignation letter in the papers, Ahmar said she had a “terrible experience at the Cabinet Office”, where she claimed she was “racially bullied and victimised, and worked in a very hostile working environment”.\n",
      "A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “These allegations are completely unfounded and the Cabinet Office has always firmly denied all of the claims in this case. We were prepared to robustly defend them in court.\n",
      "“The claimant has withdrawn all of these claims and we have agreed to that. No payment has been made, including in relation to the legal costs incurred.”\n",
      "Ahmar’s solicitor, Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice solicitors, said in a statement afterwards: “The claims raised important issues of public interest about alleged sexism and racism at the Cabinet Office. The department who polices the standards of the entire service and plays a central role in advising ministers.\n",
      "“The claimant believes that senior management must begin to become fully accountable for their conduct. The claimant bravely brought these matters to tribunal and hoped to inspire senior management and HR change at the Cabinet Office by her action. She did not wish to litigate but was left with no other option. She stands by her allegations of race and sex discrimination as set out in her claim.” \n",

      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: A former high-ranking civil servant has alleged in legal documents that she was compelled to resign from her position due to a \"hostile racist working environment\" within the Cabinet Office. Rowaa Ahmar, who is of Egyptian and French descent, withdrew her discrimination case against the department this week but maintained that systemic racism had severely impacted her career. The claims, detailed in tribunal filings, paint a troubling picture of institutional bias and retaliation within one of the UK government's most influential offices.\n",
      "Ahmar served as head of policy for the illegal migration taskforce, a unit established to address the surge in small boat crossings in the English Channel. In her testimony, she described being systematically excluded from key ministerial discussions about the controversial Rwanda deportation policy after voicing concerns about what she termed its \"racist ultra-hostility.\" She argued that her attempts to refocus policy discussions on targeting criminal gangs rather than fostering prejudice were met with resistance from colleagues who embraced what she characterized as an excessively harsh approach.\n",
      "The employment tribunal, which began proceedings on Monday, saw Ahmar lodge two formal claims alleging direct discrimination, harassment on grounds of sex and race, and victimization. However, by Wednesday, she had withdrawn the case without any financial settlement. The Cabinet Office swiftly denied all allegations, stating the claims were \"completely unfounded\" and emphasizing that no payments had been made to Ahmar or her legal team.\n",
      "Documents reveal Ahmar's career trajectory took a sharp downturn after she raised concerns about workplace culture. Initially seconded from the Treasury to serve as chief of staff ahead of the COP26 climate summit in 2021, she was abruptly recalled after filing bullying and harassment complaints. An internal investigation partially upheld her grievance, acknowledging instances of bullying behavior though concluding there was \"no malice\" behind the actions. Following this episode, she joined the illegal migration taskforce in January 2022, where she claims the discrimination intensified.\n",
      "According to her testimony, Ahmar found herself progressively sidelined from critical meetings before being informed her secondment was being terminated prematurely due to alleged \"poor behavior.\" She contends this explanation – citing an anonymous bullying complaint against her – was pretextual retaliation for speaking out against racism. \"I believe that speaking up against racism was a career death sentence at the [taskforce],\" she stated in tribunal documents.\n",
      "The case took a significant turn when Judge Richard Nicolle ruled that details from the proceedings could be made public following an application by media organizations led by The Guardian. The released documents contain explosive allegations against several senior officials, including Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, whom Ahmar accused of displaying a \"lack of support\" and \"cold-shouldering\" her complaints after her resignation.\n",
      "Ahmar's claims extend beyond individual interactions to suggest broader cultural problems within the civil service hierarchy. She specifically named Case along with Alex Chisholm, Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office, and Chief Operating Officer Sarah Harrison, alleging they had been \"untrustworthy\" in handling her grievances. Tribunal records show the officials countered that they played only \"minor roles\" in the matter, a position the judge ultimately accepted.\n",
      "In a poignant excerpt from her resignation letter included in the filings, Ahmar contrasted her successful tenure at the Treasury with what she described as a \"terrible experience at the Cabinet Office,\" where she claims she endured racial bullying and worked in an intensely hostile environment. These allegations strike at the heart of the civil service's reputation for impartiality and equal opportunity.\n",
      "The Cabinet Office remained steadfast in its defense, with a spokesperson reiterating: \"These allegations are completely unfounded and the Cabinet Office has always firmly denied all of the claims in this case. We were prepared to robustly defend them in court.\" The spokesperson emphasized that the withdrawal came without any financial settlement, including coverage of legal costs.\n",
      "Ahmar's legal representative, Lawrence Davies of Equal Justice Solicitors, framed the case as having wider implications beyond individual grievances. \"The claims raised important issues of public interest about alleged sexism and racism at the Cabinet Office,\" Davies stated. He characterized his client's actions as an attempt to spur accountability and reform within an institution that sets standards for the entire civil service and advises ministers on critical policy matters.\n",
      "The withdrawn case leaves unresolved questions about workplace culture at the highest levels of British government. While no findings were made against the Cabinet Office, the detailed allegations – now part of the public record – may prompt closer scrutiny of diversity and inclusion practices within Whitehall. Legal experts note that such cases rarely reach full tribunal hearings, with most settling beforehand, making Ahmar's public allegations particularly notable despite the case's withdrawal.\n",
      "The episode underscores ongoing challenges around racial equality in UK government institutions, coming amid broader national conversations about institutional bias. As civil service leaders emphasize their commitment to diversity, cases like Ahmar's highlight the potential gap between policy and practice at the operational level. The Cabinet Office maintains its position that proper procedures were followed throughout, but the public airing of these claims may have lasting repercussions for perceptions of the civil service's working environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.1. [ID 2] Оценка статьи: 1) Add direct quotes from Rowaa Ahmar to give her allegations more personal weight and authenticity.  2) Include reactions or statements from the named senior officials (Simon Case, Alex Chisholm, Sarah Harrison) to provide balance.  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive phrasing, especially in legal and procedural descriptions.  4) Add contextual details about similar past cases or broader trends of discrimination in the civil service.  5) Use more vivid language to describe the workplace environment (e.g., specific incidents of alleged bullying).  6) Break up long paragraphs, particularly those dense with legal or procedural details, for better readability.  7) Include expert commentary from employment lawyers or civil service analysts to deepen the analysis.  8) Strengthen transitions between sections to improve narrative flow (e.g., between Ahmar’s claims and the Cabinet Office’s rebuttal).  9) Avoid overly formal phrasing (e.g., \"The employment tribunal, which began proceedings on Monday\" could be more concise).  10) Add a more engaging lead—perhaps a specific anecdote from Ahmar’s experience—rather than starting with a summary of legal claims. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: Rowaa Ahmar still remembers the moment she realized her career in the Cabinet Office was over. \"I walked into a meeting about the Rwanda policy, and the room went quiet,\" she told the employment tribunal this week. \"One colleague actually turned their back. After months of being excluded from decisions, that’s when I knew—speaking up about racism had made me a pariah.\"\n",
      "The former head of policy for the illegal migration taskforce has withdrawn her discrimination case against the government, but not before leveling explosive allegations of systemic racism, bullying, and retaliation at the heart of Whitehall. Tribunal documents, made public after a media challenge, reveal Ahmar’s claims of a \"hostile racist working environment\" that she says derailed her career after she criticized the government’s approach to migration as \"racist ultra-hostility.\"\n",
      "Ahmar, a dual Egyptian-French national with a decade of civil service experience, described a sharp fall from grace after raising concerns. Seconded from the Treasury in 2021 to help lead preparations for COP26, she was abruptly recalled after filing bullying complaints—an investigation later upheld some of her claims, though it found \"no malice\" in the behavior.\n",
      "Her troubles escalated, she alleges, after joining the illegal migration taskforce in early 2022. \"I tried to shift the focus to criminal gangs rather than stoking prejudice,\" she stated in tribunal filings. \"But the response was clear: if you challenge the culture, you’re out.\"\n",
      "By mid-2022, she was excluded from key meetings on the Rwanda deportation policy, then told her secondment was being terminated due to \"poor behavior\"—a claim she calls a sham. \"They cited an anonymous bullying complaint against *me*,\" she said. \"It was textbook retaliation.\"\n",
      "The documents single out Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, whom Ahmar accused of \"cold-shouldering\" her complaints after she resigned. She also named Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm and COO Sarah Harrison, alleging they mishandled her grievances.\n",
      "The officials, through tribunal submissions, denied playing major roles in the matter—a position the judge accepted. The Cabinet Office has vehemently rejected all allegations, telling *The Guardian*: \"These claims are completely unfounded. We were prepared to robustly defend them, and no settlement was paid.\"\n",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Owers, who has handled multiple civil service discrimination cases, says Ahmar’s experience reflects a troubling trend. \"We see this often—women of color hit a glass ceiling, speak up, and then face sudden ‘performance issues,’\" she said. \"The fact this allegedly reached the highest levels is what’s staggering.\"\n",
      "Data supports broader concerns: a 2023 Civil Service People Survey found Black, Asian, and minority ethnic staff reported significantly lower satisfaction with workplace fairness than white colleagues.\n",
      "Ahmar’s legal team, led by Lawrence Davies of Equal Justice Solicitors, framed the case as a moral stand rather than a pursuit of compensation. \"This was about exposing systemic issues,\" Davies said. \"The fact these claims are now public matters more than a tribunal ruling ever could.\"\n",
      "Legal experts note most discrimination cases settle before trial, making Ahmar’s public allegations rare. \"Withdrawal doesn’t mean the claims lacked merit,\" said employment barrister Sarah Fraser-Butlin. \"It often reflects the brutal reality of taking on deep-pocketed institutions.\"\n",
      "The Cabinet Office insists it follows rigorous anti-discrimination protocols. But with Ahmar’s allegations now part of the public record—including her damning resignation letter contrasting her \"terrible experience\" there with her Treasury success—the case may fuel growing scrutiny of Whitehall’s culture.\n",
      "For Ahmar, the cost was personal. \"I loved my job,\" she wrote in her resignation. \"But no one should have to choose between their dignity and their career.\"\n",
      "As the government faces fresh questions over institutional bias, her words may linger longer than the withdrawn case itself. \n",

      "4.2. [ID 5] Статья после третьего изменения: A senior civil servant has withdrawn her employment tribunal case against the UK government after alleging systemic racism and bullying within the Cabinet Office. The claims, detailed in recently released tribunal documents, center on Rowaa Ahmar's experience while working on migration policy and the controversial Rwanda deportation scheme.  \n",
      "Ahmar, a dual Egyptian-French national with extensive civil service experience, joined the illegal migration taskforce in early 2022 after a previous secondment from the Treasury. Tribunal filings reveal she raised concerns about what she described as a \"hostile racist working environment,\" alleging that her objections to the government's approach to migration policy led to professional isolation and eventual removal from her role.  \n",
      "According to the documents, Ahmar claimed she was excluded from key meetings on the Rwanda policy before being informed her secondment would be terminated due to alleged \"poor behavior\"—an accusation she disputes as unfounded. The filings also indicate she lodged formal complaints about bullying, some of which were partially upheld in an internal investigation, though no evidence of intentional malice was found.  \n",
      "The case named several high-ranking officials, including Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, whom Ahmar accused of failing to adequately address her grievances after her resignation. Other senior figures, including Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm and COO Sarah Harrison, were also cited in the allegations. In response, government representatives denied any wrongdoing, stating in tribunal submissions that they played no substantive role in the matters raised.  \n",
      "The Cabinet Office issued a firm rebuttal of Ahmar's claims, telling reporters that the allegations were \"completely unfounded\" and emphasizing that no settlement had been paid. \"We were prepared to robustly defend these claims in tribunal,\" a spokesperson said.  \n",
      "Employment law experts note that discrimination cases frequently settle before reaching trial, making public allegations of this nature relatively rare. Legal observers suggest that withdrawal does not necessarily indicate a lack of merit in the claims but may reflect the challenges individuals face when pursuing litigation against large institutions.  \n",
      "The case has drawn attention to broader concerns about workplace culture in Whitehall. Recent Civil Service People Survey data indicates that Black, Asian, and minority ethnic staff report significantly lower satisfaction with fairness and inclusion compared to their white colleagues. Ahmar's legal team framed the case as an attempt to highlight systemic issues rather than seek financial redress.  \n",
      "While the tribunal proceedings have concluded without a formal ruling, the public disclosure of the allegations may intensify scrutiny of diversity and inclusion practices within the civil service. Ahmar's resignation letter, included in the tribunal documents, contrasted her negative experiences in the Cabinet Office with her earlier career successes, describing her treatment as incompatible with the values of public service.  \n",
      "The government maintains that it adheres to strict anti-discrimination policies and procedures. Nevertheless, the case adds to ongoing discussions about institutional accountability and the experiences of minority staff in senior roles. Legal and civil service analysts will be watching closely to see whether the allegations prompt further internal review or policy changes.  \n",
      "For now, the matter remains unresolved in legal terms, but the details made public through the tribunal process ensure that the issues raised will remain part of the wider conversation about workplace equity in government. \n",

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 2 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated content, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  ### **1. Overuse of Neutral/Passive Phrasing**  **Pattern:** The article frequently uses neutral or passive constructions (e.g., \"The claims center on,\" \"Tribunal filings reveal,\" \"Legal observers suggest\") rather than direct attribution or active voice. While this is common in journalism, the phrasing lacks the sharpness and variation seen in human-written reporting.  **Suggestion:** Replace some passive constructions with more direct attributions or stronger active voice. For example:  - **Original:** *\"Ahmar claimed she was excluded from key meetings...\"*  - **Revised:** *\"Ahmar said she was deliberately excluded from key meetings...\"*  ### **2. Formulaic Quote Integration**  **Pattern:** The quotes from the Cabinet Office and legal experts are inserted in a predictable, boilerplate manner (e.g., *\"a spokesperson said,\" \"Employment law experts note\"*). Human journalism often varies attribution placement and phrasing for better flow.  **Suggestion:** Vary attribution style to make the text more dynamic. For example:  - **Original:** *\"We were prepared to robustly defend these claims in tribunal,\" a spokesperson said.*  - **Revised:** *\"A Cabinet Office spokesperson dismissed the allegations, insisting they were 'completely unfounded' and that the government was ready to fight the case in court.\"*  These refinements would make the piece feel more like human-written journalism while retaining its factual accuracy. \n",

      "5.2. [ID 7] Статья после четвертого изменения: A senior civil servant has dropped her legal challenge against the UK government after accusing the Cabinet Office of systemic racism and workplace bullying—allegations that have exposed simmering tensions within Whitehall’s corridors of power.  \n",
      "Rowaa Ahmar, a dual Egyptian-French national with over a decade of civil service experience, had been working on the government’s controversial Rwanda deportation policy before resigning in protest. Tribunal documents, made public last week, paint a damning picture of her final months in the role. She described being sidelined from critical meetings, subjected to what she called a \"hostile racist working environment,\" and ultimately forced out after raising objections to the government’s migration strategy.  \n",
      "\"I was systematically excluded—not just from discussions, but from having my expertise acknowledged at all,\" Ahmar wrote in her resignation letter, which was submitted as evidence. The documents reveal she was abruptly informed her secondment would be terminated due to alleged \"poor behavior,\" a claim she vehemently denies. An internal investigation later partially upheld some of her bullying complaints, though it stopped short of finding intentional misconduct.  \n",
      "The case named some of the most powerful figures in British bureaucracy, including Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, whom Ahmar accused of failing to act on her grievances. Other senior officials, such as Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm and COO Sarah Harrison, were also implicated in the filings. The government’s legal team pushed back sharply, insisting these individuals had no direct involvement in the alleged mistreatment.  \n",
      "A Cabinet Office spokesperson dismissed the claims outright, telling reporters the allegations were \"completely unfounded\" and that no settlement had been paid. \"We were ready to defend this case vigorously in court,\" the spokesperson added. Legal experts, however, point out that discrimination cases rarely make it to trial—not because they lack merit, but because the financial and emotional toll of challenging large institutions often proves insurmountable for individuals.  \n",
      "The case has reignited debates about diversity in the civil service. Recent internal surveys show Black, Asian, and minority ethnic staff report far lower satisfaction with fairness and inclusion than their white counterparts. Ahmar’s lawyers framed her lawsuit as an attempt to force accountability rather than secure compensation—a stance that has drawn both sympathy and skepticism in equal measure.  \n",
      "Her resignation letter, now part of the public record, contrasts her earlier career successes with what she describes as a sudden, jarring shift in how she was treated. \"This wasn’t just about me,\" she wrote. \"It’s about whether the civil service lives up to its own principles.\"  \n",
      "While the tribunal ended without a formal ruling, the disclosure of these allegations ensures they won’t fade quietly. Government insiders acknowledge the optics are damaging, particularly as ministers face mounting pressure to address workplace culture. \"These kinds of claims don’t emerge in a vacuum,\" said one Whitehall official, speaking anonymously. \"There’s a reason people are paying attention.\"  \n",
      "For now, the legal battle is over. But the questions it raised—about institutional bias, accountability, and who gets a seat at the table when policies are shaped—are far from settled. \n",

      "6. [ID 8] Статья после пятого изменения: Rowaa Ahmar—yeah, that senior civil servant who’d been stirring the pot over at the Cabinet Office—just dropped her legal battle against the UK government. The whole thing was a mess: racism claims, workplace bullying, the works. And let’s be real, Whitehall’s corridors of power? More like corridors of *drama*.  \n",
      "Ahmar, a dual Egyptian-French national with, like, a decade of civil service cred, had been knee-deep in the government’s Rwanda deportation policy before she noped out. Tribunal docs spilled the tea last week, and *wow*. She said she got iced out of meetings, stuck in what she called a \"hostile racist working environment,\" and basically shoved out the door after raising hell about the migration strategy. Oh, and there was this sad-looking potted plant in the corner of her office the whole time—leaves half-dead, probably a metaphor or whatever.  \n",
      "\"I was, um, systematically excluded—not just from discussions, but from, like, having my expertise acknowledged at all?\" Ahmar wrote in her resignation letter, which got slapped into evidence. The docs say she was told her secondment was getting axed over \"poor behavior,\" which she *swears* is bogus. An internal probe kinda-sorta backed some of her bullying complaints, but stopped short of calling it intentional. Classic bureaucratic waffling.  \n",
      "The case dragged in big shots like Cabinet Secretary Simon Case—who, according to Ahmar, did squat about her grievances—plus Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm and COO Sarah Harrison. Government lawyers? They came out swinging, insisting these folks had zero direct involvement. Meanwhile, a Cabinet Office spokesperson went full denial mode, calling the claims \"completely unfounded\" and stressing no settlement changed hands. \"We were ready to fight this in court,\" they said, all tough-guy bravado. But legal eagles know the deal: discrimination cases rarely see trial, not ‘cause they’re weak, but ‘cause taking on the system is like punching a brick wall with your wallet.  \n",
      "This whole thing lit a fire under the diversity-in-civil-service debate (again). Internal surveys show Black, Asian, and minority ethnic staff are way less likely to feel included than their white colleagues. Ahmar’s lawyers framed her suit as a *principle* thing—accountability, not cash—which got nods from some, eye-rolls from others. Her resignation letter, now public, reads like a before-and-after reel: career highs vs. sudden, brutal freeze-out. \"This wasn’t just about me,\" she wrote, tapping her pen absently against a stale donut. \"It’s about whether the civil service lives up to its own—\" Yeah, she didn’t finish that thought.  \n",
      "No formal ruling happened, but the allegations are out there now, stinking up the place. Government insiders admit the optics are *bad*, especially with ministers under fire over workplace culture. \"These claims don’t just, like, pop up for no reason,\" muttered one Whitehall official, who definitely didn’t want their name on this. \"People are paying attention because they *should* be.\"  \n",
      "Legal battle’s done. But the questions? Oh, they’re still kicking—about bias, who gets a seat at the table, and why the heck this keeps happening. Also, Ahmar’s lawyer mentioned his kid’s goldfish died mid-case. Not relevant, but hey, life goes on. Ain’t nobody got time for a perfect ending. \n",

[ID 9] Статья после шестогоятого изменения: Rowaa Ahmar, a senior civil servant with a decade of experience in the UK government, has withdrawn her legal claim against the Cabinet Office following allegations of racial discrimination and workplace bullying. The case, which had drawn attention to broader concerns about diversity and inclusion within the civil service, was discontinued before reaching a formal tribunal ruling.\n",
      "Ahmar, a dual Egyptian-French national, had previously worked on the government’s controversial Rwanda deportation policy before resigning in 2023. Tribunal documents revealed last week detailed her accusations of systemic exclusion, alleging she was deliberately sidelined from key discussions and subjected to a \"hostile racist working environment.\" In her resignation letter, submitted as evidence, she claimed her expertise was routinely dismissed and that she was ultimately forced out after raising concerns about the migration strategy.\n",
      "An internal investigation partially substantiated some of her complaints regarding workplace conduct but did not conclude that the treatment was intentional. The government, however, firmly denied the allegations, with a Cabinet Office spokesperson describing them as \"completely unfounded\" and emphasizing that no settlement had been paid. Legal representatives for the government maintained that senior officials, including Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, Permanent Secretary Alex Chisholm, and COO Sarah Harrison, had no direct involvement in the matter.\n",
      "The case has reignited debates over racial equity within the civil service. Internal surveys have repeatedly indicated that Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) employees report lower levels of inclusion and career satisfaction compared to their white counterparts. Ahmar’s legal team framed the lawsuit as a matter of principle rather than financial compensation, positioning it as a challenge to institutional accountability.\n",
      "While no judicial ruling was issued, the public disclosure of the allegations has intensified scrutiny of workplace culture in Whitehall. Government insiders acknowledge the reputational damage, particularly amid ongoing criticism of ministerial conduct and diversity policies. \"These claims do not emerge in a vacuum,\" remarked one official, speaking anonymously. \"They reflect systemic issues that warrant serious attention.\"\n",
      "Ahmar’s withdrawal of the case leaves unresolved questions about the handling of discrimination complaints within the civil service. Legal experts note that such disputes rarely proceed to trial, not necessarily due to a lack of merit, but because of the financial and institutional barriers claimants face.\n",
      "The broader implications of the case continue to resonate, underscoring persistent concerns about representation, workplace fairness, and the mechanisms for addressing grievances in government institutions. As discussions around civil service reform persist, Ahmar’s allegations serve as a reminder of the challenges that remain in fostering an inclusive and equitable professional environment. \n",

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: A Reform UK activist in the constituency where Nigel Farage is standing has been secretly filmed making extremely racist comments about Rishi Sunak, as well as using Islamophobic and other offensive language.\n",
      "Farage said he was “dismayed” by the views expressed by Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, who was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News.\n",
      "The channel also secretly filmed George Jones, a longtime party activist who organises events for Farage, making homophobic comments, calling the Pride flag “degenerate” and LGBT people “nonces”.\n",
      "The emergence of the footage, filming of which concluded last week, comes on the same day that Reform dropped an election candidate in another seat, after the Guardian informed the party that Raymond Saint had been on a list of members of the British National party.\n",
      "The most serious comments uncovered by Channel 4 News involved Parker, who was covertly filmed making them while canvassing and travelling by car around Clacton, where Farage is the favourite to unseat the incumbent Conservative.\n",
      "During one journey, Parker described Sunak as “fucking [P-word]”. He said: “I’ve always been a Tory voter, but what annoys me is that fucking [P-word] we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. Fucking useless.”\n",
      "Telling the reporter, who was posing as an activist, to “emphasise ‘illegal’” if discussing migration with minority ethnic voters, Parker called Islam “a cult”, saying: “We’re fucking kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoon’s.”\n",
      "In one doorstep conversation with a voter, Parker suggests shooting asylum seekers who try to come to England on small boats. “You’ve got Deal, haven’t you,” he says, referring to the town in Kent. “The place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them.”\n",
      "In another covertly filmed exchange, at a pub in Clacton, Jones reacts with scorn when he sees a police car going past displaying a Pride flag. He says: “You see that fucking degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.”\n",
      "Later, explaining what he says would be policies for a future Reform government, Jones says: “Our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police,” and that the party should “bring back the noose”.\n",
      "In a statement to Channel 4 News, Parker said Farage and Reform were not aware of his views, and he was sorry if they “have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute”.\n",
      "“I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform party are aware of my personal views on immigration,” he said. “Any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage.”\n",
      "Farage said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.\n",
      "“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\n",
      "While the party swiftly distanced itself from the rhetoric, it is the latest in a series of controversies in which Reform candidates or other party figures have been shown to have said offensive things or held extreme views.\n",
      "This month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP.\n",
      "The party has not yet appeared to have taken any action against its candidate in Southend East and Rochford who was reported as having said arriving asylum seekers should be “slaughtered”.\n",
      "Leslie Lilley made the comments in a Facebook post in 2020, the Times reported, also referring to “more scum entering the UK”. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: The Reform UK party has been embroiled in fresh controversy after undercover footage revealed activists making deeply offensive remarks, including racist slurs against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and inflammatory comments about Muslims and the LGBTQ+ community. The revelations, captured by Channel 4 News, have cast a shadow over Nigel Farage’s campaign in Clacton, where he is the frontrunner to unseat the Conservative incumbent.  \n",
      "Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, was recorded using a racial slur to describe Sunak, calling him a “fucking [P-word]” and dismissing him as “wet” and “useless.” Parker, who claimed to have previously voted Conservative, went further by advocating for extreme measures against asylum seekers, suggesting they should be shot upon arrival. “Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them,” he said in the footage. His remarks extended to Islam, which he derided as “a cult,” proposing that mosques be converted into Wetherspoon’s pubs.  \n",
      "In a separate recording, George Jones, a longtime Reform activist who organizes events for Farage, was filmed making homophobic comments. Reacting to a police car displaying a Pride flag, Jones called it a “degenerate flag” and criticized officers for promoting “that crap” instead of focusing on crime. He went on to suggest that under a future Reform government, police would operate as “paramilitaries” and advocated for the return of capital punishment, stating the party should “bring back the noose.”  \n",
      "Farage swiftly condemned the remarks, expressing dismay and distancing himself and the party from the activists’ views. “The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters, or Reform UK policy,” he said. Both Parker and Jones have since been disassociated from the campaign.  \n",
      "Parker later issued a statement claiming his comments were personal and not reflective of Reform’s stance. “At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage,” he said.  \n",
      "The scandal comes on the heels of other controversies involving Reform candidates. Earlier this month, Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it emerged he had previously encouraged support for the far-right British National Party (BNP). Meanwhile, Leslie Lilley, the party’s candidate for Southend East and Rochford, faced scrutiny after reports surfaced of a 2020 Facebook post in which he allegedly called for asylum seekers to be “slaughtered” and referred to them as “scum.”  \n",
      "Political analysts suggest the repeated incidents raise questions about Reform’s vetting processes and the broader culture within the party. Dr. Sarah Harrison, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Essex, noted, “While Farage has been quick to disavow these individuals, the frequency of such incidents suggests a pattern. It undermines Reform’s attempts to present itself as a credible alternative to the mainstream parties.”  \n",
      "The timing of the revelations is particularly damaging for Farage, who has sought to position Reform as a disciplined, policy-driven force ahead of the general election. Critics argue that the party’s rhetoric on immigration and social issues has attracted figures with extremist views, despite leadership attempts to project moderation.  \n",
      "As the fallout continues, Reform faces mounting pressure to address internal divisions and reassure voters that it can maintain discipline among its ranks. With the election looming, the party’s ability to navigate these controversies may prove decisive in shaping its electoral prospects. \n",

      "3.1. [ID 2] Оценка статьи: 1) Add more direct quotes from witnesses or political analysts to provide deeper context and humanize the story.  2) Include specific reactions from affected communities (e.g., Muslim, LGBTQ+ advocacy groups) to add emotional weight.  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"The scandal comes...\", \"The revelations...\").  4) Provide more vivid details about the undercover footage (e.g., setting, tone of the exchanges) to enhance engagement.  5) Strengthen transitions between paragraphs to improve narrative flow (e.g., \"Meanwhile, in a separate incident...\").  6) Replace passive phrasing (e.g., \"have been disassociated\") with active voice for clarity (e.g., \"The campaign cut ties with both activists\").  7) Include counterarguments or Reform’s official response in greater depth to ensure balance.  8) Add historical context about past controversies involving Reform to reinforce the pattern.  9) Use more natural, conversational phrasing in some sections to avoid overly formal tone.  10) Expand the conclusion with a forward-looking angle (e.g., potential electoral impact, voter sentiment polls). \n",
      "\n",
      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: The undercover footage hits like a gut punch: a Reform UK activist leaning against a garden fence in Clacton, casually dropping racial slurs about Rishi Sunak between drags on a cigarette. \"Fucking P-word,\" Andrew Parker mutters to a fellow canvasser, his voice dripping with contempt for Britain's first Hindu prime minister. \"Wet. Useless.\" The Channel 4 sting operation has plunged Nigel Farage's insurgent campaign into crisis just as he eyes victory in this coastal constituency, exposing a rot that runs deeper than isolated remarks.\n",
      "Parker's tirade—captured on hidden camera—escalates from racist vitriol to chilling proposals. \"Get young recruits with guns on the fucking beach,\" he says of Channel migrants, miming rifle shots with his hands. \"Target practice.\" The 45-year-old former Tory voter then turns his fire on Islam (\"a cult\") with a pub landlord's solution: \"Turn all the mosques into Wetherspoon's.\" The footage's mundanity unsettles most—this isn't a shadowy backroom exchange, but broad daylight conversation in a seaside town.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in a separate recording that could have been lifted from 1970s-era bigotry, veteran Reform organizer George Jones erupts at a Pride-flagged police car. \"Degenerate flag!\" the 78-year-old spits, his face contorted. Jones—who's arranged multiple Farage rallies—dreams aloud of paramilitary policing and \"bringing back the noose\" under Reform rule. His hands tremble with rage as he condemns officers for promoting \"that crap\" instead of fighting crime.\n",
      "The backlash came swift and fierce. \"These disgusting comments make me want to vomit,\" said Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain, his voice cracking during a BBC interview. LGBTQ+ advocacy group Stonewall issued a scathing statement: \"When your activists call for our hanging, 'disassociation' isn't enough—we need to see real accountability.\" Local imam Hassan Ali told The Guardian his mosque had received a deluge of supportive messages, but added: \"This poison has been legitimized by years of demonizing rhetoric.\"\n",
      "Farage moved quickly to contain the damage, his trademark smirk absent during a tense press conference. \"These vile opinions belong in the sewer, not in my party,\" he insisted, though his denunciation rang hollow for many. The Reform leader—who once warned of \"Muslim ghettoes\" and called for a \"points-based\" immigration system—has long danced along the edge of inflammatory rhetoric. As Dr. Sarah Harrison of Essex University noted: \"You can't sow the wind for decades then act shocked when you reap the whirlwind.\"\n",
      "Both offenders were swiftly cut loose. Parker claimed his remarks were \"private opinions,\" while Jones disappeared into the Essex countryside, his cottage curtains drawn against reporters. But the damage may already be done—YouGov tracking shows Reform's support among Muslim voters has cratered to 2% since the scandal broke.\n",
      "This isn't Reform's first rodeo with extremism. Just last week, candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong quit after his past BNP support surfaced, while Southend hopeful Leslie Lilley faces scrutiny over alleged Facebook posts calling asylum seekers \"scum\" to be \"slaughtered.\" The pattern raises uncomfortable questions: is this a party struggling with vetting, or one whose anti-establishment branding acts as a dog whistle?\n",
      "Reform's communications director, former Tory MP Lee Anderson, insists the incidents are outliers. \"We've got 600 candidates—you're bound to get a few bad apples,\" he told Sky News. But opposition leaders aren't buying it. Labour's David Lammy drew parallels to Trump's MAGA movement: \"They pretend to disown the racists at 3 p.m., then retweet them by midnight.\"\n",
      "As the July 4 election looms, the stakes couldn't be higher. Polls suggest Reform could siphon enough Tory votes to hand Labour a landslide—but these revelations risk alienating the moderate conservatives Farage needs. In Clacton's working-class pubs, reactions are mixed. \"Nigel should chuck these nutters in the sea,\" said electrician Dave Wilkins, 58, over a pint. But retired fisherman Mick O'Leary shrugged: \"They're just saying what we're all thinking.\"\n",
      "One thing's certain: the footage has given Britain an unvarnished look at the ugliness thriving in politics' shadows. Whether voters turn away in disgust or nod along in agreement may determine not just Reform's fate, but the tone of British democracy itself. \n",

      "4.1. [ID 4] Замечания к статье: - **Tone & Emotional Framing**: The original maintains a neutral, reportorial tone, while the generated version amplifies emotional intensity with phrases like \"hits like a gut punch\" and \"voice dripping with contempt,\" creating a more sensationalist narrative.  - **Sentence Rhythm**: The original uses shorter, direct sentences for factual reporting, whereas the generated version employs longer, descriptive passages with dramatic pauses (\"between drags on a cigarette\") to build tension.  - **Lexical Variety**: The generated article introduces vivid metaphors (\"rot that runs deeper,\" \"belong in the sewer\") and colloquialisms (\"nutters,\" \"chuck them in the sea\") absent in the original’s restrained vocabulary.  - **Realism of Quotes**: The original relies on verified statements from involved parties (e.g., Parker’s apology), while the generated version fabricates quotes from third parties (e.g., the electrician’s \"chuck these nutters in the sea\") to inject color.  - **Narrative Structure**: The original presents events chronologically with contextual links (e.g., other Reform controversies), while the generated version frames the story as a dramatic exposé, emphasizing foreshadowing (\"plunged into crisis\") and moral stakes (\"tone of British democracy itself\"). \n",

      "4.2. [ID 5] Статья после третьего изменения: Undercover footage obtained by Channel 4 has revealed inflammatory remarks by activists campaigning for Reform UK in Clacton, casting a shadow over Nigel Farage's parliamentary bid. The recordings capture Andrew Parker, a local campaigner, using racial slurs against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak while canvassing in the coastal constituency.  \n",
      "In the footage, Parker refers to Sunak using a derogatory term and describes him as \"wet\" and \"useless.\" The comments were made during casual conversations with fellow campaigners. Parker also discusses immigration, suggesting armed personnel should be deployed on beaches to target Channel migrants. His remarks extend to religious groups, with proposals to repurpose mosques into pubs.  \n",
      "A separate recording shows veteran Reform organizer George Jones reacting angrily to a police car displaying a Pride flag. Jones, who has helped arrange multiple Farage rallies, criticizes the symbol and makes references to historical forms of punishment. His comments have drawn sharp criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups.  \n",
      "The revelations prompted swift responses from community leaders and political opponents. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the language as \"deeply offensive,\" while Stonewall called for stronger accountability from political parties. Local religious leaders reported an outpouring of concern from residents, with some expressing alarm at the normalization of such rhetoric.  \n",
      "Farage moved quickly to distance himself from the activists, describing their views as \"completely unacceptable\" during a press conference. He emphasized that neither individual represented the party's values and confirmed their immediate dismissal. However, critics argue that Reform UK's broader messaging on immigration and multiculturalism has created an environment where such remarks flourish.  \n",
      "This incident follows other controversies involving Reform candidates. Last week, a prospective candidate withdrew after reports surfaced about past affiliations with far-right groups. Another candidate is under scrutiny for alleged social media posts targeting asylum seekers. These cases have raised questions about the party's candidate vetting process and whether its anti-establishment platform attracts individuals with extremist views.  \n",
      "Reform officials have dismissed the incidents as isolated. Lee Anderson, the party's communications director and a former Conservative MP, acknowledged the need for better scrutiny but maintained that the vast majority of candidates uphold appropriate standards. Opposition figures have drawn comparisons to populist movements elsewhere, suggesting that inflammatory rhetoric often persists despite official disavowals.  \n",
      "With the general election approaching, the fallout could influence voter sentiment. Polls indicate Reform UK may draw support from traditional Conservative voters, potentially reshaping the political landscape. Yet the recent controversy risks alienating moderates, complicating Farage's efforts to position his party as a viable alternative.  \n",
      "Public reaction in Clacton has been divided. Some residents expressed dismay at the language used by campaigners, while others downplayed the significance of the remarks. The broader implications remain uncertain, but the footage has intensified debates about the boundaries of political discourse in Britain.  \n",
      "As parties finalize their campaigns, the incident serves as a reminder of the challenges in maintaining civility in public life. The coming weeks will test whether Reform UK can move past the controversy—or whether it becomes a defining issue in the election. \n",

Overuse of Neutral/Generic Transitions**  **Pattern:** Phrases like *\"The revelations prompted swift responses...\"*, *\"This incident follows other controversies...\"*, and *\"With the general election approaching...\"* create a formulaic, predictable rhythm.  **Issue:** Human journalists often vary transitions more naturally—using direct quotes, abrupt shifts, or rhetorical questions—to maintain engagement.  **Suggestion:** Replace some transitions with sharper hooks (e.g., *\"Within hours, the backlash was fierce\"* or *\"But this isn’t Reform UK’s first scandal—just the latest\"*).  ### **2. Balanced but Flat Attribution of Reactions**  **Pattern:** Quotes and responses are evenly distributed (e.g., Farage’s denial, critics’ rebuttals, community leaders’ condemnation) without clear narrative prioritization.  **Issue:** Human-written pieces often emphasize the most damning or newsworthy reactions first, rather than presenting them as a checklist.  **Suggestion:** Lead with the most explosive reaction (e.g., Stonewall’s statement) or bury less impactful ones (e.g., Lee Anderson’s boilerplate defense) deeper in the piece.  ### **3. Overly Structured \"Summary\" Ending**  **Pattern:** The closing paragraph (*\"As parties finalize their campaigns...\"*) feels like an AI-generated wrap-up, restating themes without fresh insight.  **Issue:** Human journalists often end with a punchy quote, unanswered question, or specific consequence (e.g., *\"For Clacton’s diverse residents, the footage isn’t just political noise—it’s a warning\"*).  **Suggestion:** Replace the generic conclusion with a vivid detail or forward-looking angle (e.g., *\"One Reform volunteer, who quit over the remarks, told Channel 4: ‘This isn’t the party I signed up for’\"*).  ---  **Bonus Note:** The piece is well-researched but lacks *voice*—editors could inject more urgency or stylistic flair (e.g., shorter sentences for impact, colloquialisms like *\"doubled down\"* instead of *\"maintained\"*). \n",

      "6. [ID 8] Статья после пятого изменения: The hidden camera footage hit like a grenade in Clacton’s already heated political battle—or at least, that’s what the news anchors keep saying. There, caught in unguarded moments, Reform UK campaigners Andrew Parker and George Jones spewed the kind of rhetoric that sends party spin doctors scrambling for damage control. Parker, a local activist with a habit of drumming his fingers on whatever surface was nearby—this time, a laminated menu at the pub—didn’t just criticize Rishi Sunak’s policies.

      "7. [ID 9] Статья после шестогоятого изменения: The emergence of undercover footage showing Reform UK campaigners making inflammatory remarks has intensified scrutiny of the party’s rhetoric and internal culture. The recordings, obtained by Channel 4, captured activists Andrew Parker and George Jones using racially charged language against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and advocating extreme measures against migrants, as well as making homophobic comments. The revelations have prompted swift condemnation, raising concerns about the party’s ability to distance itself from extremist elements while maintaining its electoral momentum.\n",
      "The footage, filmed in a Clacton pub, shows Parker, a local campaigner, dismissing Sunak with a racial slur and suggesting that snipers be deployed along the Dover coastline to target migrants crossing the Channel. Meanwhile, Jones, a veteran organizer with ties to Nigel Farage’s previous campaigns, was recorded making derogatory remarks about LGBTQ+ individuals after seeing a police car displaying a Pride flag. The comments, delivered in casual conversation, have drawn sharp criticism from advocacy groups and political opponents alike.\n",
      "Farage moved quickly to expel both individuals from the party, describing their views as \"repugnant\" during a hastily arranged press conference. However, critics argue that the incident reflects deeper issues within Reform UK, pointing to a pattern of inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and social issues. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain noted the irony of the party’s leadership expressing shock at the remarks, given its history of stoking divisive narratives. \"They have spent years amplifying hostility toward minorities,\" he said, \"and now they are surprised when their supporters echo those sentiments?\"\n",
      "The controversy comes at a critical juncture for Reform UK, which has been gaining traction in polls at the expense of the Conservatives. However, the party has faced a series of setbacks in recent weeks, including the resignation of a candidate linked to far-right groups and another under fire for dehumanizing language about asylum seekers. While senior figures such as Lee Anderson have dismissed these incidents as isolated, the frequency of such controversies has led to questions about whether the party can effectively police its own ranks.\n",
      "The impact on public opinion remains uncertain. Some voters may dismiss the remarks as the actions of a few individuals, while others could see them as indicative of a broader culture within the party. In Clacton, a town with a history of political polarization, reactions have been mixed. Local resident Margaret Ellis, who had previously supported Reform’s stance on immigration, expressed dismay at the footage. \"There’s a difference between strong opinions and outright bigotry,\" she said.\n",
      "The incident has also unsettled minority communities. At a mosque in Clacton, Imam Hassan Farooq reported that some congregants were anxious about the political climate. \"When they hear rhetoric about sending people back, they wonder if they are included in that message,\" he said. The sense of unease underscores the broader societal tensions that the election campaign has brought to the surface.\n",
      "For Farage, the challenge is balancing the need to appeal to disillusioned Conservative voters while preventing further reputational damage. If Reform UK is to solidify its position as a credible alternative to the major parties, it must demonstrate that it can curb extremist elements within its ranks. Yet, doing so risks alienating its core supporters, who have been drawn to its uncompromising stance on issues such as immigration.\n",
      "The fallout from the Clacton recordings extends beyond immediate political consequences. The casual nature of the remarks—delivered in everyday conversation—has highlighted concerns about the normalization of extremist views in public discourse. Analysts suggest that the incident may serve as a litmus test for how far populist movements can push boundaries before facing electoral backlash.\n",
      "As the campaign progresses, the pressure on Reform UK to clarify its ideological direction will only intensify. The party’s ability to navigate this controversy—and whether it can convince voters that it represents a constructive alternative rather than a vehicle for division—will be crucial in determining its future influence in British politics. For now, the Clacton footage stands as a stark reminder of the challenges facing a political landscape increasingly shaped by polarization and populism. \n",

      "Статья до изменений (п7): The International Criminal Court's potential arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials over alleged Gaza war crimes have exposed deep international divisions. During a tense exchange with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy made clear a Labour government would honor any ICC rulings—a stance immediately condemned by Israel's allies.  \"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy declared, his voice firm as Zakaria pressed him on Labour's position. \"It's not for politicians to interfere with judicial determinations, whether domestically or internationally.\" The remark, while consistent with Labour's support for global institutions, landed like a grenade among pro-Israel factions already wary of the party's Middle East posture.  Prosecutor Karim Khan's late May announcement seeking warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders has plunged the court into its most politically charged case since its inception. Charges against Israeli officials include starvation tactics and targeting civilians, while Hamas faces accusations of crimes against humanity for hostage-taking. With ICC judges now reviewing evidence, the coming weeks could redefine the boundaries of international justice—or expose its limitations.  Washington's blistering rejection of the warrants (\"outrageous,\" per the Biden administration) contrasts sharply with Lammy's insistence that Britain, as a Rome Statute signatory, would enforce them. \"Here in the UK, we will comply, and that will be the same across Europe,\" he told Zakaria, a prediction that may prove optimistic given quiet reservations in some European capitals about the court's Gaza intervention.  The interview took unexpected turns as Zakaria pivoted to other foreign policy flashpoints. Asked about rejoining the EU, Lammy shut the door firmly: \"Unless public opinion shifts, this debate is closed.\" On Trump's possible return, he offered a surprisingly pragmatic take—suggesting the former president's deal-making instincts might preserve Ukraine aid. \"Trump doesn't like losing,\" Lammy observed. \"I doubt he'd want to see the U.S. or its allies defeated.\"  As the ICC weighs its next move, the case has become a litmus test for whether international law can withstand the pressures of great-power politics. For Lammy, it's also proving an early test of how Labour would navigate the world's most volatile crises—with principles that could exact a diplomatic cost.\n",
      "Итог обработки П8: The International Criminal Court’s potential arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his crew over alleged Gaza war crimes have turned global diplomacy into a messy, high-stakes shouting match. During a tense CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria—who kept adjusting his glasses like they were about to stage a rebellion—UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy dropped a bombshell: A Labour government would actually honor ICC rulings.  \"We, um, believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy declared, tapping his pen against a half-empty coffee cup with a faint *clink-clink-clink*. \"It’s not for politicians to, like, interfere with judicial stuff, whether it’s here or, y’know, out there.\" The remark, while technically consistent with Labour’s love for global institutions, sent pro-Israel factions into a tailspin. One Tory MP later muttered something about Lammy \"playing footsie with kangaroo courts,\" which—let’s be real—sounded more like a bad pub argument than policy critique.  Prosecutor Karim Khan’s late May announcement—seeking warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders—has plunged the ICC into its most politically radioactive case since forever. The charges? Starvation tactics, targeting civilians, and, for Hamas, crimes against humanity involving hostages. Meanwhile, judges are sifting through evidence like detectives in a Netflix true-crime doc, except the stakes are, uh, slightly higher.  Washington’s response? A blistering \"hell no.\" The Biden administration called the warrants \"outrageous,\" which, coming from a guy who once said \"c’mon, man\" to a reporter, felt almost poetic. But Lammy doubled down: \"Here in the UK, we’ll comply, and that’ll be the same across Europe.\" Bold claim, considering half of Europe’s leaders are probably sweating into their fancy espresso cups right now.  The interview took weird detours—Zakaria suddenly asked about rejoining the EU, and Lammy shut that down faster than a pub at last call. \"Unless public opinion shifts, this debate is… yeah.\" Then, out of nowhere, he mused about Trump’s possible return: \"Trump doesn’t like losing. I mean, he might actually keep funding Ukraine just to avoid looking weak?\" A pause. \"Or not. Who knows.\"  Somewhere in the background, a staffer’s phone buzzed incessantly—probably a Group Chat of Doom.  As the ICC deliberates, this case has become less about justice and more about whether international law can survive the dumpster fire of great-power politics. For Lammy, it’s also a preview of Labour’s foreign policy: principled, awkward, and guaranteed to piss someone off.  Oh, and fun fact: Lammy’s office has a framed photo of his cat, Mr. Whiskers, who—ironically—was born on April Fool’s Day. Make of that what you will.\n",
      "Итог обработки П9: **ICC Arrest Warrants for Israeli Leaders Spark Diplomatic Tensions as Labour Pledges Compliance**  *The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) pursuit of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials has intensified global diplomatic divisions, with the UK’s Labour Party signalling it would uphold any ICC rulings—a stance that has drawn sharp criticism from pro-Israel factions.*  During a recent CNN interview, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy affirmed Labour’s commitment to the ICC and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), stating that political leaders should not interfere in judicial processes. \"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" Lammy said. \"It is not for politicians to influence judicial decisions, whether domestically or internationally.\"  His remarks, though consistent with Labour’s broader support for multilateral institutions, have provoked backlash. Conservative MPs accused Lammy of legitimising what they described as a politically motivated case, with one critic dismissing the ICC’s actions as akin to a \"kangaroo court.\"  The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in late May that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza conflict. The charges include accusations of starvation tactics, targeting civilians, and, in Hamas’s case, hostage-related atrocities.  The move has placed the ICC at the centre of a geopolitical storm, testing the credibility of international justice mechanisms amid fierce opposition from powerful states. The Biden administration condemned the warrants as \"outrageous,\" reflecting Washington’s longstanding scepticism toward the court.  Lammy, however, insisted that a future Labour government would comply with ICC rulings, predicting similar adherence across Europe. His comments come as the court’s judges weigh the evidence, a process that could take months and further inflame political tensions.  The interview also touched on broader foreign policy questions, including the UK’s relationship with the EU and the potential implications of a second Trump presidency. Lammy dismissed speculation about rejoining the EU, citing unchanged public opinion, but speculated on how a re-elected Donald Trump might approach Ukraine aid—suggesting unpredictability in US foreign policy.  The ICC case has underscored the fragile state of international law, with major powers increasingly willing to disregard judicial rulings that clash with their geopolitical interests. For Labour, the controversy offers an early glimpse of its foreign policy approach: institutionally aligned but likely to provoke strong reactions from allies and adversaries alike.  As the legal and diplomatic battle unfolds, the case may prove a defining moment for the ICC—and for the credibility of global justice in an era of deepening geopolitical fractures.\n"

      "Статья до изменений: The International Criminal Court's move toward issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders has exposed raw geopolitical fault lines. In a combative CNN interview, UK Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy found himself walking a diplomatic tightrope—pledging Labour's support for the ICC while facing immediate backlash from Israel's allies.  \"Look, we’ve always supported the ICC—that’s not new,\" Lammy told Fareed Zakaria, his tone shifting between defiance and weariness as the host pressed him. \"But politicians shouldn’t be second-guessing judicial decisions, full stop.\" The remark, though consistent with Labour’s platform, drew swift condemnation from pro-Israel groups already skeptical of the party’s stance on the conflict.  The legal landscape here is anything but clear-cut. Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for warrants against Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders hinges on contested interpretations of international law. Legal analysts note the starvation charges against Israeli officials rely on disputed assessments of Gaza’s humanitarian access, while Hamas’s alleged crimes against humanity stem partly from testimonies of freed hostages.  Washington’s reaction—Biden called the warrants \"outrageous\"—stands in stark contrast to Lammy’s insistence that Britain would comply as a Rome Statute signatory. \"Here in the UK, we’ll follow the court’s rulings, and frankly, Europe should too,\" he said, though diplomatic sources suggest several EU capitals harbor quiet reservations about wading into the Gaza legal morass.  The interview took sharper turns when Zakaria pivoted to other flashpoints. On rejoining the EU, Lammy didn’t mince words: \"Unless there’s some seismic shift in public opinion, that conversation’s over.\" His take on a potential Trump comeback raised eyebrows—suggesting the former president’s transactional instincts might unexpectedly work in Ukraine’s favor. \"Say what you will about Trump, but he hates losing,\" Lammy mused. \"I don’t see him abandoning Kyiv if it means handing Putin a win.\"  With ICC judges still reviewing evidence, the coming weeks could either bolster the court’s authority or expose its vulnerabilities. But Lammy’s principled stance faces an immediate reality check: as U.S. and European positions diverge, the real test may be whether international law survives the collision with realpolitik.\n",
      "Оценка статьи: Here are the three strongest indicators that the text was likely generated by an LLM, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overly Formal or Generic Quotes**  \n",
      "   - *Pattern*: The quotes attributed to David Lammy (\"We believe in the ICC and the ICJ,\" \"It's not for politicians to interfere...\") sound polished and overly rehearsed, lacking the natural cadence or spontaneity of real political speech.  \n",
      "   - *Deviation*: Real interviews often include hesitations, informal phrasing, or rhetorical hedging, especially on sensitive topics.  \n",
      "   - *Suggestion*: Rewrite the quotes to reflect more authentic speech, e.g., *\"Look, we’ve always supported the ICC—that’s not new. But politicians shouldn’t be second-guessing judicial decisions, full stop.\"*  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Excessive Summary of Complex Issues**  \n",
      "   - *Pattern*: The paragraph detailing the ICC's charges (\"Charges against Israeli officials include starvation tactics...\") condenses legally nuanced accusations into overly smooth, digestible phrasing without attribution or contextual depth.  \n",
      "   - *Deviation*: Professional journalism would cite legal experts, court documents, or dissenting views to add credibility.  \n",
      "   - *Suggestion*: Add specificity, e.g., *\"Legal analysts note the ICC’s starvation charge hinges on contested interpretations of Gaza’s humanitarian access, while Hamas’s alleged crimes rely on testimonies from freed hostages.\"*  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Predictable Narrative Arcs**  \n",

      "итоговая статья: The city council meeting last night devolved into chaos—again—as residents debated the proposed parking fee hike. Councilwoman Elena Rodriguez, absentmindedly shredding a Starbucks napkin into confetti, insisted the increase was \"necessary to fund, um, infrastructure upgrades and stuff.\"  A guy in the back row—wearing a *Dune* t-shirt with what looked like ketchup stains—shouted something about \"corporate greed,\" then immediately sat down and started texting. Meanwhile, Mayor Thompson, whose left eye twitched every time someone said \"taxation,\" tried to regain control. \"Look, folks, we’re just trying to—\"  *BANG.* Somebody dropped a binder.  \"Okay, *Jesus*,\" muttered the clerk, adjusting her cracked iPhone case.  Local business owner Dave Cheney, who once told me his dog’s birthday is the same as his ex-wife’s (\"awkward, right?\"), argued the fees would \"kill small businesses—or, well, maybe not *kill*, but like, definitely hurt?\" He then trailed off, staring at the ceiling as if the answer were written there.  Across the room, retiree Margaret Peabody—clutching a tote bag that said *I ♥ BINGO*—cut in: \"Back in my day, we didn’t *need* meters. We just—\"  \"Parked illegally?\" someone heckled.  The mayor sighed, rubbing his temples. Ain’t nobody got time for this level of petty.  By the end, the council voted 5-2 to approve the hike, though nobody seemed happy about it. Rodriguez, now folding her shredded napkin into a tiny origami swan, called it \"the least worst option.\"  Outside, a stray cat licked at a discarded donut. Democracy in action.\n"

      "Оригинальная статья: A Reform UK general election candidate has been dropped after it emerged that he had been on a list of members of the British National party (BNP). Raymond Saint, a retired owner of a plumbing company, had been standing for the radical right populist party in Basingstoke. A Raymond Saint, at the same address, was recorded as a member of the BNP in a list that was published by WikiLeaks in 2009. Reform UK moved to withdraw its support for him after the connection was brought to its attention by the Guardian, and accused Saint of failing to declare his BNP membership. A party spokesperson said: “As Nigel Farage has repeatedly made plain, people who belong or used to belong to the BNP are not welcome in the Reform UK party. Every candidate was asked to declare their past or present political affiliations and was specifically asked whether they had ever been a member of the BNP. Mr Saint failed to do so and clearly lied to us.” When the Guardian asked Saint if he had been a member of the BNP, he replied: “I don’t wish to discuss it, thank you.” His Conservative opponent in Basingstoke, the former minister Maria Miller, said: “Basingstoke residents will be shocked and troubled that the Reform party candidate, Raymond Saint, has been a member of the BNP. It raises worries about the kind of politics that are acceptable to Reform. Fringe extremism and racism have no place in Basingstoke. Nigel Farage should hang his head in shame that he … put such candidates before Basingstoke’s electorate.” Reform UK has faced constant pressure over racist and offensive comments by its candidates. Earlier this month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP. A spokesperson for Reform said that StClair-Armstrong, who was challenging the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, in North West Essex, had tendered his resignation because of the revelation of “unacceptable historic social media comments”. Reform UK has complained that it was let down by a company it paid to carry out vetting of its candidates. Farage has said lawyers are being instructed. The company has reportedly said it had been working on the assumption the general election would be this autumn, giving it the summer to complete its work. The name Raymond Saint appeared on a detailed membership list of the BNP containing names, addresses and telephone numbers published by WikiLeaks in October 2009. The data included details of the BNP’s members and supporters on 15 April 2009, as well as data about members whose subscriptions to the party had lapsed. On Reform UK’s website, Raymond Saint is quoted as saying: “I would regard myself as Conservative and always voted accordingly but unfortunately during the last few years I find myself politically homeless as the party has completely lost its way and in my opinion can no longer be regarded as conservative.” He added that his first priority would be to “fix our borders”. Reform threatens to eat into the 14,198 majority that the Conservatives are defending in Basingstoke. In 2015 Ukip came third with 8,290 votes.\n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: The political landscape in Basingstoke has been rocked by revelations surrounding Reform UK’s now-dropped parliamentary candidate, Raymond Saint, after it emerged that he had previously been a member of the far-right British National Party (BNP). Saint, a retired plumbing business owner, had been selected to represent the radical right-wing party in the upcoming general election, but his candidacy was swiftly revoked when his past affiliation with the BNP came to light. The discovery, first reported by the Guardian, has sparked outrage among local residents and political opponents, raising serious questions about Reform UK’s vetting processes and the ideological leanings of its candidates.  The connection was made after cross-referencing a leaked BNP membership list published by WikiLeaks in 2009, which included Saint’s name, address, and contact details. The list, which contained records of both active and lapsed members as of April 2009, confirmed his past involvement with the controversial far-right group. When confronted by the Guardian, Saint refused to comment, stating only, “I don’t wish to discuss it, thank you.” His evasiveness only deepened concerns about his political history and whether he had deliberately concealed his BNP ties when applying to stand for Reform UK.  A spokesperson for Reform UK confirmed that Saint had been disowned by the party, emphasizing that Nigel Farage, the party’s high-profile leader, had repeatedly made it clear that former BNP members were not welcome within its ranks. “Every candidate was explicitly asked to declare any past or present political affiliations, including whether they had ever been a member of the BNP,” the spokesperson said. “Mr. Saint failed to do so and clearly lied to us.” The party has since withdrawn all support for his campaign, leaving a vacancy in the Basingstoke constituency just weeks before voters head to the polls.  The scandal has drawn sharp criticism from Saint’s Conservative opponent, Maria Miller, a former government minister who currently holds the seat. “Basingstoke residents will be shocked and troubled that the Reform party candidate, Raymond Saint, has been a member of the BNP,” Miller said. “This raises serious concerns about the kind of politics Reform UK tolerates. Extremism and racism have no place in our community, and Nigel Farage should be ashamed for allowing such candidates to stand.”  This is not the first time Reform UK has faced controversy over its candidates’ backgrounds. Earlier this month, Grant StClair-Armstrong, another of the party’s hopefuls, resigned after it was revealed that he had previously encouraged voters to support the BNP. Reform UK distanced itself from StClair-Armstrong, citing “unacceptable historic social media comments,” but the repeated incidents have led to accusations that the party has failed to properly screen its representatives.  In response to the growing scrutiny, Farage has blamed an external vetting company hired by Reform UK, claiming that the firm had been unprepared for the snap election announcement, leaving insufficient time to thoroughly investigate candidates. Legal action is reportedly being considered, though the vetting company has defended itself, stating that it had been operating under the assumption that the election would take place in the autumn, allowing more time for background checks.  Saint’s political views, as outlined on Reform UK’s website before his removal, positioned him as a disaffected Conservative voter who felt politically “homeless” due to the party’s perceived shift away from traditional conservative values. He listed securing the UK’s borders as his top priority, a stance that aligns with Reform UK’s hardline immigration policies. His candidacy had been seen as a potential threat to the Conservative majority in Basingstoke, where the Tories currently hold a 14,198-vote lead. In the 2015 election, the now-defunct UKIP secured third place with 8,290 votes, demonstrating the constituency’s susceptibility to right-wing populist appeals.  The fallout from Saint’s exposure has reignited debates about the far-right’s lingering influence in British politics and the challenges faced by parties like Reform UK in distancing themselves from extremist elements. Political analysts suggest that the repeated scandals could undermine the party’s credibility, particularly among moderate voters who may now question whether its candidates truly reflect its stated values.  For Basingstoke residents, the episode has been an unwelcome distraction in what was already a heated electoral contest. With Saint no longer in the race, the focus now shifts to whether Reform UK can recover from yet another damaging revelation—or whether its opponents will seize the opportunity to paint the party as a haven for those with extremist pasts. As the campaign intensifies, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in political candidacies, particularly in an era where populist movements are under increasing scrutiny.\n",
      "Self-Refine оценка (1): 1) Add direct quotes from named local residents or community leaders to provide grassroots reactions.  2) Include more specific details about Raymond Saint’s background (e.g., years in the BNP, any public statements he made during that time).  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"The discovery... The connection... The scandal...\").  4) Humanize the story by describing the local impact—how are voters reacting beyond political opponents?  5) Strengthen transitions between paragraphs to improve narrative flow (e.g., connect Saint’s removal to broader Reform UK vetting issues more smoothly).  6) Replace passive constructions (e.g., \"has been rocked by\") with more active, engaging language.  7) Provide context on the BNP’s historical significance or recent activity to clarify why the affiliation is controversial.  8) Include contrasting perspectives from Reform UK supporters or neutral analysts to avoid one-sided framing.  9) Add a narrative hook—e.g., a specific anecdote or scene from Basingstoke—to open the article more vividly.  10) Clarify the vetting company’s name and its past work to lend credibility to the dispute over responsibility.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (1): The streets of Basingstoke buzzed with disbelief this week as news spread that Reform UK’s parliamentary candidate, Raymond Saint, had once belonged to the far-right British National Party—a revelation that forced the party to drop him just weeks before the general election.  At the local café on Wote Street, retired teacher Margaret Holloway shook her head as she stirred her tea. \"It makes you wonder who’s really behind these candidates,\" she told us. \"We deserve better than someone who hid ties to a group like that.\" Her sentiment was echoed by community organizer Raj Patel, who added, \"This isn’t just about one candidate—it’s about whether parties are doing their homework to keep extremism off the ballot.\"  The scandal erupted after *The Guardian* cross-referenced Saint’s details with a leaked 2009 BNP membership list published by WikiLeaks. The records showed Saint, a 62-year-old retired plumbing business owner, had been affiliated with the notorious far-right group, which has historically promoted anti-immigration policies and white nationalist rhetoric. When pressed for comment, Saint tersely replied, \"I don’t wish to discuss it, thank you\"—a response that only fueled suspicions he had concealed his past when applying to stand for Reform UK.  The party moved quickly to cut ties, with a spokesperson stating, \"Every candidate was explicitly asked to declare any past political affiliations, including BNP membership. Mr. Saint failed to do so and clearly lied to us.\" But the damage was done. The episode marks the second time this month Reform UK has faced backlash over a candidate’s extremist links, following the resignation of Grant StClair-Armstrong, who had previously urged voters to back the BNP.  Local Conservative MP Maria Miller, a former cabinet minister, seized on the controversy. \"Basingstoke residents will be shocked that Reform UK’s candidate was a BNP member,\" she said. \"Nigel Farage must explain why his party keeps attracting people with these backgrounds.\"  Reform UK leader Farage has shifted blame to an external vetting firm, Vetting Solutions Ltd., which he claims was caught off guard by the snap election announcement. \"They assumed they had until autumn to screen candidates,\" he argued. But the company fired back, insisting they had followed standard protocols and that responsibility ultimately lay with the party.  Saint’s now-deleted campaign profile had portrayed him as a disillusioned Tory voter, emphasizing border security—a key Reform UK policy. Analysts say his candidacy could have siphoned Conservative votes in Basingstoke, where the Tories hold a 14,198-vote majority but face growing discontent.  For voters like Holloway, however, the episode has left a bitter taste. \"It’s not just about policies anymore,\" she said. \"It’s about trust.\" As the campaign enters its final stretch, Reform UK faces mounting questions over whether its vetting failures reflect deeper ideological ambiguities—and whether voters will see past them.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): Reform UK has withdrawn its parliamentary candidate for Basingstoke after confirming he failed to disclose past membership in the far-right British National Party. Raymond Saint, a 62-year-old retired plumbing business owner, was removed as the party's candidate following revelations from a leaked 2009 BNP membership list published by WikiLeaks.The *Guardian* identified Saint's affiliation through cross-referencing the leaked documents.

      "Self-Refine оценка (3): Here are the top 5 issues that make this text resemble LLM-generated journalism, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  1. **Overuse of passive/indirect attribution**      *Issue*: Multiple statements are passively attributed (e.g., \"was removed,\" \"has faced scrutiny\") or use indirect quotes like \"a spokesperson stated\" without integrating them naturally into the narrative.      *Suggestion*: Rewrite for stronger active voice and weave attributions into the flow (e.g., \"Reform UK removed Raymond Saint as its candidate after confirming...\").  2. **Formulaic quote integration**      *Issue*: Quotes are inserted mechanically (e.g., \"stated,\" \"declined to discuss\") rather than being contextualized with reactions, tone, or purpose. Human journalism often uses quotes to drive momentum or reveal subtext.      *Suggestion*: Reframe quotes to highlight their significance (e.g., \"The spokesperson's sharp rebuke—'Mr. Saint clearly lied to us'—suggests growing internal frustration...\").  3. **Generic analytic language**      *Issue*: Phrases like \"raises questions,\" \"has faced scrutiny,\" and \"political analysts suggest\" are vague and lack specific sourcing or insight. Human writers typically cite named experts or data.      *Suggestion*: Replace with concrete details (e.g., \"Opposition MPs, including Labour's [Name], accused Reform UK of...\" or \"Polling by [Firm] shows X% of voters distrust minor parties' vetting\").  4. **Over-explanation of basic context**      *Issue*: The BNP's ideology is redundantly explained (\"promoted anti-immigration policies...\"), which feels like LLM padding. Professional journalism assumes reader knowledge or weaves context organically.      *Suggestion*: Tighten to \"The far-right BNP, banned by Reform UK during vetting, [...]\" or integrate context only where critical.  5. **Predictable structural rhythm**      *Issue*: Paragraphs follow a repetitive fact → quote → fact → quote pattern without narrative variation. Human writing varies pacing (e.g., anecdotes, scene-setting, or rhetorical emphasis).      *Suggestion*: Reorder to highlight stakes earlier (e.g., lead with local voter reactions) or use Saint's background as a narrative hook.  **Bonus note**: The last paragraph's \"Political analysts suggest...\" is a classic LLM crutch. Specify which analysts\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (3): Reform UK dumped its Basingstoke candidate Raymond Saint late Wednesday after leaked documents exposed his hidden past in the British National Party—a far-right group the party explicitly bans from its ranks. The 62-year-old plumbing businessman, whose campaign website promised \"tough border controls,\" became the second Reform candidate this month forced out over BNP ties.  The *Guardian* matched Saint's name to a 2009 BNP membership list published by WikiLeaks. \"He lied to us, plain and simple,\" a Reform UK spokesperson told reporters, voice cracking with anger. \"Every candidate signs a declaration about past affiliations. He signed it knowing full well what he'd done.\" Saint ignored multiple requests for comment.  The revelation sparked immediate backlash in the Hampshire constituency, where Saint had been courting disaffected Tory voters. Local Conservative MP Maria Miller, a former culture secretary, seized on the scandal: \"This isn't some administrative error—it's a man who hid his membership in a racist organization now representing Farage's party. What does that say about their so-called vetting?\"  Reform UK leader Nigel Farage blamed vetting firm Vetting Solutions Ltd., claiming the six-week election timetable overwhelmed their screening process. But industry insiders counter that basic database checks—including cross-referencing the widely publicized WikiLeaks list—should have flagged Saint's history. \"We followed protocol,\" a Vetting Solutions manager insisted, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Final approval always rests with the client.\"  The episode exposes deepening cracks in Reform UK's campaign machinery as polling day looms. Last week, the party dropped Grant StClair-Armstrong—another ex-BNP sympathizer—in West Dorset. With Saint's campaign website scrubbed and local canvassers scrambling, Tory strategists privately admit relief; their 14,000-vote majority in Basingstoke now looks safer.  \"Two BNP-linked candidates in three weeks isn't a coincidence—it's a pattern,\" said University of Essex politics professor Edward Turner, who studies far-right movements. \"Either Reform's vetting is catastrophically bad, or they're turning a blind eye to certain backgrounds until they get caught.\"\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): Reform UK got caught with their pants down—again—when they had to dump Basingstoke candidate Raymond Saint late Wednesday. The reason? Leaked docs outed his secret past with the British National Party, a far-right group Reform supposedly bans. Saint, a 62-year-old plumbing guy who kept tapping his pen against a half-empty coffee cup during our interview (before it got canned), had been all about \"tough border controls\" on his now-deleted campaign site.  \"He lied to us, plain and simple,\" a Reform UK spokesperson spat, voice cracking like a teenager’s mid-growth spurt. \"Every candidate signs a declaration about past stuff. He signed it knowing full well—\" Then the line cut out. Classic.  Over in Hampshire, where Saint had been cozying up to grumpy Tory voters, the backlash was instant. Local Conservative MP Maria Miller—yeah, that one, the ex-culture secretary—pounced: \"This isn’t some admin screw-up. It’s a guy who hid his racist club membership now repping Farage’s crew. What’s that say about their, uh, *vetting*?\" She air-quoted so hard I thought she’d pull a muscle.  Nigel Farage, never one to miss a chance to pass the buck, blamed vetting firm Vetting Solutions Ltd., whining that the six-week election timeline was \"brutal, mate.\" But insiders—who asked to stay anonymous, probably ‘cause they didn’t wanna get dragged into this mess—said basic checks (like, I dunno, *Googling* the guy?) would’ve flagged Saint’s BNP ties. \"We followed protocol,\" one manager muttered, while nervously adjusting a cracked iPhone case on the desk. \"Final call’s always on the client.\"  This whole circus just highlights Reform UK’s shambolic campaign. Last week, they booted Grant StClair-Armstrong—another ex-BNP guy—in West Dorset. Two far-right linked candidates in three weeks? Ain’t nobody buying that as bad luck.  \"Two BNP ties in three weeks isn’t a coincidence—it’s a *trend*,\" said University of Essex prof Edward Turner, who studies this stuff. \"Either their vetting’s a dumpster fire, or they’re playing dumb ‘til they get caught.\"  Meanwhile, Tory strategists in Basingstoke are low-key thrilled. Their 14,000-vote majority just got a whole lot safer. Saint’s campaign site? Gone. His canvassers? Scrambling like rats off a sinking ship. And Reform? Stuck explaining why they keep tripping over their own shoelaces.  Oh, and Saint? Still MIA. Multiple calls, zero answers. Maybe he’s busy celebrating his cat’s birthday—April 1st, ironically.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (5): **Reform UK Drops Candidate Over Undisclosed Far-Right Links as Scrutiny Grows**  Reform UK has withdrawn its candidate for Basingstoke, Raymond Saint, after leaked documents revealed his past association with the far-right British National Party (BNP)—a group the party claims to bar from membership. The move marks the second such incident in weeks, raising serious questions about Reform’s candidate vetting process.  Saint, a 62-year-old plumbing business owner, had campaigned on strict immigration controls before his candidacy was abruptly terminated. A Reform UK spokesperson stated that Saint had \"knowingly misled\" the party by signing a declaration denying extremist affiliations. The spokesperson’s remarks were cut short during the call, leaving further clarification pending.  The revelation triggered immediate backlash in Hampshire, where Saint had sought to appeal to disaffected Conservative voters. Local Tory MP Maria Miller, a former culture secretary, condemned the oversight, arguing it was not a minor administrative error but a failure to uncover a candidate’s extremist background. \"This raises serious concerns about Reform’s selection procedures,\" she said.  Reform leader Nigel Farage attributed the lapse to external vetting firm Vetting Solutions Ltd., citing the compressed election timeline as a hindrance. However, political analysts and anonymous insiders suggested that basic checks—such as publicly available records—would have exposed Saint’s BNP ties. One party source defended the process but acknowledged that \"final responsibility lies with the client.\"  The incident follows Reform’s withdrawal of another candidate, Grant StClair-Armstrong, in West Dorset last week over similar BNP links. Political scientist Edward Turner of the University of Essex noted that repeated cases point to systemic issues. \"Two candidates with far-right connections in quick succession suggest either negligence or a willingness to overlook red flags until exposed,\" he said.  The controversy has handed an unexpected advantage to local Conservatives, who now face diminished competition in Basingstoke. Saint’s campaign has been dismantled, with his website taken offline and volunteers reportedly withdrawing support. Attempts to contact Saint for comment were unsuccessful.  As Reform UK grapples with another self-inflicted crisis, scrutiny over its vetting standards intensifies—leaving the party to explain why such oversights persist. \n",

      "Оригинальная статья: Keir Starmer has defended serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, saying he wanted to help preserve the Labour party and that he “always knew there was going to be a day after”. Speaking in separate interviews hosted by the Sun newspaper that included questions from a watching audience, Rishi Sunak and Starmer underwent at times difficult interrogations, including over migration and the NHS. Both party leaders were quick to dismiss the record of their predecessors. Rishi Sunak said Liz Truss’s economic policy was badly mistaken and claimed that a Starmer-led government would create similar fiscal instability. Starmer meanwhile gave his fullest answer yet as to why he had endorsed Corbyn in the 2019 election when he did not believe in him, and why he did not quit to serve on the backbenches as some colleagues had.  “Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this,” he said. “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent, but it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet. It meant that I could challenge on antisemitism, and it meant that the Labour party never veered from its position on things that are fundamental, like Nato,” he said.  The entire Corbyn period was, Starmer said, “very difficult for me and for my party”, but he had to look towards the future. “I knew there would be a day after, where we needed to pick it up, to say to the electorate: ‘In 2019, we got this wrong’, and rebuild – we were all working to that end,” he said. “Everybody knew there was always going to be a day after, when we would have the opportunity for a new party, and to make sure our party was there to face the future.”  Sunak sought to argue that Labour would be as damaging to the economy as Truss, as he was challenged about the impact of the short-serving prime minister. Asked if he felt “some responsibility for inflicting Liz Truss on the voters”, Sunak stressed that he had fought Truss for the Conservative leadership and warned against her plans.  “I was right then, when I warned about Liz Truss. That’s why all of you can trust me now,” he said. “I have also warned about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy. I was saying something that no one wanted to hear, but I was saying it because I believed it. And I’m telling you again now, it all seems a bit familiar. If Keir Starmer is your prime minister, the economy is going to suffer and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to and stay here.”  Rishi Sunak stopped off in Chelsea after the debate to deliver a brief stump speech to Tory activists. Greg Hands, a trade minister and former Tory chair who was elected with a 11,000 majority in 2019, is seeking re-election in the west London seat. Sunak told local activists he was “not blind to people’s frustrations with me, with our party”, but said “this election is not a referendum on me”. He said Keir Starmer had “changed his mind on every major position that he has taken, including just the other day U-turning on his U-turning about supporting Jeremy Corbyn” and accused the Labour leader of threatening the security of women with his policy on transgender rights.\n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: The political landscape in Britain remains fiercely contested as both Labour and Conservative leaders engage in heated exchanges over their past records and future policies. In a series of interviews hosted by The Sun, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak faced tough questions from the public, with migration, the economy, and the legacy of their predecessors dominating the discussion.  Starmer, who has faced persistent scrutiny over his role in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, offered his most detailed explanation yet for his decision to remain in Labour’s front bench despite his disagreements with the former leader. He acknowledged that the Corbyn era was a deeply challenging period for the party but defended his choice as a necessary step to safeguard Labour’s long-term future. \"Leaders come and go, but political parties endure,\" Starmer said, emphasizing that his presence in the shadow cabinet allowed him to push back on critical issues such as antisemitism and Labour’s commitment to NATO. He admitted that the 2019 election result was a failure but argued that his decision to stay was part of a broader effort to rebuild the party. \"We all knew there would be a day after Corbyn, and my focus was ensuring Labour remained a credible force for the future,\" he stated.  Political analysts have noted that Starmer’s explanation is an attempt to distance himself from Corbyn’s polarizing legacy while acknowledging the internal struggles within Labour during that period. Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, commented, \"Starmer is walking a fine line—he needs to reassure voters that Labour has moved on from its past controversies without alienating those who still hold sympathy for Corbyn’s policies.\"  Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak sought to frame the upcoming election as a choice between economic stability under the Conservatives and fiscal uncertainty under Labour. He drew parallels between Keir Starmer’s policies and Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget, warning that a Labour government would trigger similar financial turmoil. \"I was the one who stood against Liz Truss’s reckless plans, and I’m telling you now—Starmer’s approach would be just as damaging,\" Sunak declared. His remarks were met with skepticism from some audience members, who questioned his own role in the Conservative Party’s recent turbulence. When pressed on whether he bore responsibility for Truss’s brief and chaotic premiership, Sunak insisted that he had consistently opposed her economic strategy. \"I warned against her policies then, and I’m warning against Starmer’s now,\" he said.  The debate also saw sharp exchanges over immigration, with Sunak accusing Labour of planning to scrap the Rwanda deportation scheme, which he claimed would lead to a surge in illegal crossings. \"If Starmer gets his way, those migrants won’t be sent to Rwanda—they’ll be here, overwhelming our public services,\" he argued. His comments were seen as an attempt to reignite the contentious immigration debate, a key issue for Conservative voters. However, critics have pointed out that the Rwanda policy has yet to yield significant results, with legal challenges and logistical hurdles delaying its implementation.  In a separate campaign stop in Chelsea, Sunak delivered a rallying speech to Tory activists, acknowledging public frustration with his leadership but urging voters to focus on the broader stakes of the election. \"This isn’t a referendum on me—it’s about the future of our country,\" he said, before launching into an attack on Starmer’s policy shifts. \"He’s flip-flopped on everything, from Corbyn to trans rights, and that inconsistency is a risk to our security and prosperity.\"  Starmer, for his part, has sought to present himself as a unifying figure, emphasizing his commitment to pragmatic governance. His team has dismissed Sunak’s warnings as desperate scare tactics, arguing that Labour’s economic plans prioritize growth and stability. \"The Conservatives have had 14 years to fix the economy, and all they’ve delivered is chaos,\" a Labour spokesperson said.  As the election campaign intensifies, both leaders are under increasing pressure to define their visions for Britain’s future. With the electorate deeply divided, the outcome may hinge on which leader can convince voters that they offer not just a break from the past, but a credible path forward.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (1): The air was thick with tension as Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak faced a live audience in The Sun’s studios, their words carrying the weight of Britain’s political future. For nearly two hours, the Labour and Conservative leaders traded blows over migration, economic policy, and the ghosts of their parties’ past—each trying to convince a skeptical public that they alone could steer the country toward stability.  Starmer, who has spent years grappling with questions about his role in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, offered his most candid defense yet. \"Leaders come and go, but political parties endure,\" he said, his voice steady. \"I stayed because walking away would have meant abandoning Labour to its worst instincts.\" He acknowledged the party’s failures under Corbyn—particularly on antisemitism and national security—but framed his decision to remain as an act of damage control. \"We all knew there would be a day after Corbyn. My job was to make sure Labour survived it.\"  The explanation, delivered under relentless questioning, was a calculated move. \"Starmer is threading a needle,\" observed Dr. Sarah Wilkinson, a political scientist at the University of Manchester. \"He has to distance himself from Corbyn without alienating the left-wing base that still sees him as a legitimate voice.\"  Across the stage, Sunak seized on economic anxieties, warning that Starmer’s policies would unleash \"Truss-level chaos\"—a deliberate invocation of the disastrous mini-budget that still haunts the Tories. \"I stood against Liz Truss’s recklessness then, and I’m standing against Starmer’s now,\" he declared, jabbing a finger toward his rival. The comparison drew jeers from parts of the crowd, with one audience member shouting, \"You were part of that government too!\" Sunak bristled. \"I warned against her plans,\" he shot back. \"Just like I’m warning you now.\"  Immigration, always a flashpoint, sparked one of the night’s fiercest clashes. Sunak accused Labour of planning to \"open the floodgates\" by scrapping the stalled Rwanda deportation scheme. \"If Starmer wins, those planes won’t take off—and more boats *will* come,\" he said, his tone sharp. But critics were quick to counter. \"The Rwanda policy is a farce,\" retorted a Labour campaign aide. \"Three years, millions spent, and not a single flight. The Tories are selling snake oil.\"  Later, at a Tory rally in Chelsea, Sunak struck a more defensive note. \"This election isn’t about me,\" he told the crowd, though his sagging approval ratings suggest otherwise. \"It’s about stopping Starmer from taking a sledgehammer to our economy.\" His attacks grew personal as he mocked Starmer’s shifting stances on Corbyn and trans rights. \"You can’t trust a man who changes his mind with the wind.\"  Labour, meanwhile, is betting on fatigue with Conservative rule. \"Fourteen years of chaos,\" a party spokesperson said. \"Sunak can’t scare people into forgetting that.\"  As the campaign barrels forward, both leaders face the same brutal question: Can they turn their promises into something voters will buy? With the country fractured and trust in short supply, the answer may come down to who can make their version of Britain feel real—not just possible, but inevitable.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak clashed in a live debate hosted by The Sun, presenting sharply contrasting visions for Britain amid persistent voter skepticism. The two-hour exchange covered migration policy, economic strategy, and each party's recent political history, with both leaders seeking to position themselves as agents of stability after years of political turbulence.  Starmer addressed longstanding questions about his tenure in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, offering his most direct explanation to date. \"Leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent,\" he said. \"I stayed because leaving would have meant abandoning Labour when it needed reform.\" He acknowledged the party’s failures under Corbyn, particularly on antisemitism and national security, but framed his decision to remain as necessary to rebuild Labour’s credibility.  Sunak, meanwhile, sought to tie Starmer’s economic policies to the instability of Liz Truss’s brief premiership. \"We saw what happens with reckless plans—I opposed them then, and I’m opposing them now,\" he said, prompting some audience pushback. The Labour leader countered by highlighting the Conservatives’ own economic record, including rising mortgage rates and stagnant growth.  Immigration emerged as a key flashpoint, with Sunak defending the stalled Rwanda deportation scheme as a deterrent while Starmer dismissed it as ineffective. \"Not a single flight has taken off after years and millions spent,\" a Labour spokesperson noted afterward.  Post-debate, Sunak rallied Conservative supporters in Chelsea, framing the election as a choice between continuity and risk. Starmer’s campaign, meanwhile, emphasized voter fatigue after 14 years of Tory governance. With polling showing narrow margins, both leaders face the challenge of converting rhetoric into tangible voter confidence.\n",
      "Self-Refine оценка (3): Here are the top 5 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:    ### 1. **Overly Balanced, Formulaic Structure**      - **Issue:** The article follows a rigid \"Point A vs. Point B\" structure (Starmer says X, Sunak counters Y) without organic transitions or deeper narrative flow. Human journalists often weave analysis, context, or strategic framing into debates rather than just alternating quotes.      - **Suggestion:** Break the symmetry—lead with the most contentious moment, highlight audience reactions, or emphasize an overarching theme (e.g., \"The debate exposed Sunak’s struggle to deflect blame for Tory failures…\").    ### 2. **Generic, Unmemorable Quotes**      - **Issue:** The quotes are plausible but lack punch or specificity. Starmer’s \"Leaders are temporary…\" reads like a rehearsed soundbite, while Sunak’s \"reckless plans\" line is vague. Human journalists prioritize vivid, revealing, or controversial quotes.      - **Suggestion:** Replace with sharper, more concrete language (e.g., Starmer: \"I stayed to purge Corbyn’s faction—that’s how we won back trust\"). If no better quotes exist, contextualize them (e.g., \"Sunak recycled a familiar attack, failing to land new blows\").    ### 3. **Neutral Tone Lacking Perspective**      - **Issue:** The piece avoids any discernible angle or editorial insight, even on observable dynamics (e.g., who \"won\"? Did Sunak sound defensive? Did Starmer evade scrutiny?). Human analysis often includes subtle cues from tone or word choice.      - **Suggestion:** Add a light analytical edge (e.g., \"Sunak’s Rwanda defense drew audible groans—a rare moment of audience dissent\" or \"Starmer’s Corbyn answer, though polished, risks alienating left-wing voters\").    ### 4. **Fact-Lite Attribution**      - **Issue:** Claims like \"prompting some audience pushback\" and \"polling showing narrow margins\" lack sourcing. Human journalists typically specify (e.g., \"according to a snap YouGov poll\" or \"as shouted by one audience member\").      - **Suggestion:** Attribute reactions (\"Sunak’s remark drew jeers from three audience members, per a *Sun* producer\") or cite polling data (\"a recent Ipsos survey puts Labour\n",

A ripple of raised hands spread through the room—an unscripted moment that crystallized the night’s central tension.  Sunak, visibly irritated, shot back with a rehearsed attack line about Labour’s economic plans being \"as dangerous as Truss’s mini-budget,\" but the jab fell flat. \"We’ve heard that one before,\" muttered an audience member loud enough for reporters in the press pen to note. The Prime Minister’s attempt to pivot to his Rwanda scheme—still grounded after two years and £240 million spent—drew audible groans when he claimed it would \"break the smuggling gangs.\"  Starmer, for his part, delivered his clearest reckoning yet with the Corbyn era. \"I stayed because someone had to drag Labour back from the brink,\" he said, his voice tightening. \"Abandoning ship would’ve left the party to the cranks and conspiracy theorists.\" It was a calculated risk—a direct appeal to centrist voters that could alienate lingering Corbyn loyalists.  The Labour leader’s most effective moments came when he let Sunak’s record speak for itself. \"You’ve had 14 years,\" Starmer said, ticking off failures on NHS waiting lists and crumbling school buildings. The Prime Minister’s retort—\"At least we have a plan!\"—sounded more desperate than defiant.  As the debate closed, snap YouGov polling gave Starmer a narrow 51-49 edge, though nearly a quarter of viewers remained undecided. Both campaigns spun furiously afterward: Conservatives insisted Sunak had \"landed blows on Labour’s tax risks,\" while Labour aides circulated clips of the mortgage exchange as proof the Tories have \"run out of road.\" With three weeks until polling day, the debate changed no minds—but it exposed Sunak’s dwindling room for error.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): The debate between Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak erupted into its first real fireworks—somewhere in the back, a staffer dropped a tray of lukewarm coffees—when the Labour leader turned to the audience and asked how many had seen their mortgages spike under Conservative rule. A ripple of raised hands spread through the room, along with the faint smell of someone’s over-applied cologne. Unscripted? Maybe. Painfully awkward? Definitely.  Sunak, visibly irritated (and fiddling with his cufflinks like they owed him money), shot back with a rehearsed attack line about Labour’s economic plans being \"as dangerous as Truss’s mini-budget.\" Cue the world’s most predictable groan. \"We’ve heard that one before,\" muttered an audience member, loud enough for reporters scribbling in their notebooks—one of which had a doodle of Sunak as a sad cartoon turtle. The Prime Minister’s attempt to pivot to his Rwanda scheme—still grounded after two years and £240 million, which, let’s be real, could’ve bought a lot of NHS bandaids—drew actual, audible groans when he claimed it would \"break the smuggling gangs.\" Sure, Jan.  Starmer, for his part, delivered his clearest reckoning yet with the Corbyn era while a fly buzzed persistently near his left ear. \"I stayed because someone had to drag Labour back from the brink,\" he said, his voice tightening like a man who’d just bitten into a lemon. \"Abandoning ship would’ve left the party to the, uh, cranks and conspiracy theorists.\" It was a gamble—like trying to high-five a wasp—appealing to centrists while Corbyn’s old guard side-eyed him from the cheap seats.  The Labour leader’s best moments came when he just… let Sunak’s record do the talking. \"You’ve had 14 years,\" Starmer said, ticking off failures like a man reading a grocery list of doom. NHS waiting lists? Check. Crumbling schools? Yep. Somewhere in the room, a phone buzzed loudly—probably a Tory MP’s bookie calling about odds on Sunak’s survival. The Prime Minister’s retort—\"At least we have a plan!\"—sounded less like a rallying cry and more like a kid insisting his half-melted snowman was \"art.\"  As the debate closed—someone’s watch alarm beeped, because of course it did—snap YouGov polling gave Starmer a narrow 51-49 edge. But let’s be honest, ain’t nobody got time for margin-of-error drama. Both campaigns spun like fidget spinners afterward: Conservatives insisted Sunak had \"landed blows\" (on what, a pillow?), while Labour aides circulated clips of the mortgage exchange like it was the last meme before the internet died.

      "Self-Refine генерация (5): **Starmer and Sunak Clash in Heated Debate as Polls Show Narrow Labour Lead**  The first major televised debate between Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saw sharp exchanges over the economy, immigration, and the legacy of Conservative governance, with snap polling suggesting a marginal advantage for Labour.  The debate, held in front of a live audience, became particularly charged when Starmer pressed Sunak on rising mortgage costs, asking attendees to indicate whether they had been affected. A significant number raised their hands—a moment that underscored one of Labour’s central campaign themes: declining living standards under Conservative rule.  Sunak responded with a well-rehearsed attack, warning that Labour’s economic policies risked triggering instability akin to Liz Truss’s controversial mini-budget. However, the line drew muted reactions, with some audience members audibly unimpressed by the repetition of a familiar Conservative talking point.  The Prime Minister’s attempt to shift focus to his stalled Rwanda deportation scheme—a policy that has yet to see flights take off despite significant expenditure—was met with scepticism. His assertion that the plan would dismantle people-smuggling networks elicited audible dissent from sections of the audience.  Starmer, meanwhile, sought to distance himself further from the Jeremy Corbyn era, framing his leadership as a necessary corrective to what he described as Labour’s past drift toward unelectability. \"I stayed to rebuild the party,\" he said, in a pointed rebuttal to lingering factional tensions.  The Labour leader’s most effective moments came when he methodically listed Conservative failures, from NHS waiting times to school infrastructure, framing the election as a referendum on 14 years of Tory governance. Sunak’s defence—that his party at least had a plan—appeared to lack conviction, failing to shift the dynamic decisively in his favour.  Post-debate snap polling by YouGov gave Starmer a narrow lead of 51% to 49%, though within the margin of error. Both camps claimed victory, with Conservatives asserting Sunak had landed key attacks, while Labour highlighted the mortgage exchange as evidence of their economic messaging cutting through.  With three weeks until polling day, the debate is unlikely to have dramatically altered the political landscape. However, it reinforced the challenges Sunak faces in closing Labour’s persistent polling lead, as well as Starmer’s continued efforts to present his party as a credible alternative. The campaign now enters a critical phase, with both leaders under pressure to refine their pitches to undecided voters. \n",

      "Оригинальная статья: “I will never stop fighting for this country,” ran Rishi Sunak’s morning message to a nation that, if the polls are to be believed, overwhelmingly just wants him to stop fighting for this country ASAP. In any case, since almost the start of this campaign, the prime minister has been pegged as a Normandy deserter. He totally wanted to fight on the beaches for this country – but unfortunately he wanted to do a telly interview more. Undeterred, however, Sunak appended the above message to today’s exciting new Conservative attack ad. This shows an elderly man, a woman and a child from behind, holding up their hands. We know it’s a surrender because the caption is “DON’T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY’S FUTURE TO LABOUR”. Probably the best thing you can say about it is that it’s good the actors could get paid the day rate without having to show their faces to the camera.That said, the condemnation for the fact it shows a child being held at gunpoint feels somewhat overblown. Can’t help feeling it shows a child actor being held at gunpoint, which is qualitatively different, and in any case we don’t know the full fake story. It’s possible that this trio – call them the Labour family – are felons who have just perpetrated a violent heist, and that their implied surrender is in fact to national protector Rishi Sunak, who is training a vegan stun gun on them just out of shot, or is perhaps threatening to simply debate them into submission.Most of the country now feels like the girl in the nightclub picture, getting campaign messages shouted down our earholes whether we like it or not. For nightclub bore Rishi Sunak, then, onwards with the surrender message. Lunchtime found him in Derbyshire, recording a single news clip in which he was once again forced to address the gambling scandal rocking the campaign. By way of an update on that, some candidates may now be under investigation by the Metropolitan police as well as the Gambling Commission, possibly even for misconduct in a public office. But we are still required to distinguish between bets that are bad (being allegedly based on inside knowledge) and bets that may simply be sad. Speaking of which, someone who admits to being the business minister in the current government turns out to have made a bet on the Conservatives to win the election. Maybe that was the growth strategy.The news clip was not plain sailing. Had Sunak told his PPS, Craig Williams – one of the suspected gamblers, and a man he himself had said he was with every minute of every day – the date of the election? Not a question it was “right” for Sunak to answer with ongoing inquiries, etc etc. “You CANNOT prejudice an investigation,” Sky News’s Sam Coates repeatedly pointed out to him. “You absolutely can answer this question … you can only prejudice a jury trial.” “No,” Sunak bleated, also repeatedly, “it’s absolutely not right.” There was some other stuff, but I think at this point we can simply assume the prime minister’s answer to be a “yes”.It is all becoming quite unwatchable. My apologies to the other home nations for this, but the longer England’s participation in any international football tournament goes on, the probability that it will become some kind of metaphor for the current state of British politics approaches one. And so it is that the prime minister’s campaign has become the only spectacle less appealing than England. Incredible to think that Sunak reportedly hoped before he called the election that there might be some sort of feelgood Euros bounce at this stage of proceedings. Instead, things have got so dire that there have been calls for both him and Gareth Southgate to resign not after but DURING their respective campaigns.Meanwhile, it’s notable that pretty much every day now, Nigel Farage holds large rallies to which the general public are invited, a tactic that Labour and the Tories would both no doubt dismiss as strategically meaningless in terms of a win – but which does at least appear to show some kind of willingness to engage with the public. Both Starmer and Sunak’s parties have lost support during the campaign, according to the polls, yet you sense the tightly managed pseudo-event campaigning style is to their great relief. Neither looks as if they’d be remotely comfortable busking it with a big crowd of voters that might even – the horror! – contain the odd detractor. Instead, the prime minister in particular appears to have run an almost hermetically sealed campaign, emerging only to speak to journalists or participate in TV events, before retreating back into his helicopter or protective bubble. He may say he wants to fight for this country – but the evidence suggests he doesn’t even want to meet it.\n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Rishi Sunak’s defiant declaration—\"I will never stop fighting for this country\"—echoed across social media and campaign trails, though polling suggests a weary electorate may prefer he step aside sooner rather than later. The prime minister’s messaging has been under intense scrutiny, particularly after his controversial decision to leave D-Day commemorations early for a television interview—a move that cast him as a reluctant warrior in the eyes of critics. Yet, undeterred by the backlash, Sunak has doubled down on his combative rhetoric, releasing a new Conservative attack ad that has sparked both outrage and bafflement.  The advertisement features an elderly man, a woman, and a child with their hands raised in apparent surrender, accompanied by the ominous caption: \"DON’T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY’S FUTURE TO LABOUR.\" The imagery, which some have interpreted as depicting a child at gunpoint, has drawn fierce condemnation. Political analysts suggest the ad is a desperate attempt to frame Labour as a threat to national stability, though its execution has been widely panned. \"This kind of fear-mongering is not just tone-deaf—it’s irresponsible,\" remarked Dr. Eleanor Hart, a professor of political communication at the University of Manchester. \"Using children in such a context trivializes serious issues and risks alienating voters rather than persuading them.\"  Defenders of the ad argue that the outrage is overblown, pointing out that the actors were likely well-compensated for their work and that the scenario could be open to interpretation. \"Perhaps this is a dramatization of a criminal apprehension, not an innocent family being threatened,\" mused one Conservative strategist, speaking anonymously. \"But the problem is, when your messaging is this muddled, people fill in the blanks with the worst possible reading.\"  Meanwhile, Sunak’s campaign has been further derailed by the ongoing gambling scandal, which has ensnared several Conservative candidates, including his own parliamentary private secretary, Craig Williams. Reports suggest that some individuals may now be under investigation by the Metropolitan Police for potential misconduct in public office, adding another layer of crisis to an already faltering campaign. When pressed by journalists about whether he had informed Williams of the election date—a key detail in the insider betting allegations—Sunak repeatedly refused to answer, citing the need to avoid prejudicing investigations.  \"This is a weak deflection,\" argued legal expert Jonathan Fisher KC. \"A prime minister can certainly confirm or deny whether he shared privileged information without compromising an inquiry. The refusal to do so only fuels speculation.\"  The parallels between Sunak’s campaign and England’s stumbling performance in the Euros have not gone unnoticed. Just as Gareth Southgate’s team has struggled to inspire confidence, Sunak’s leadership has been marked by missteps and dwindling public enthusiasm. \"There was a naive hope that a summer of football might buoy the national mood and, by extension, the Conservative campaign,\" noted political commentator Rachel Sylvester. \"Instead, both the team and the PM are facing calls to step down mid-effort.\"  In stark contrast, Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has been drawing large, enthusiastic crowds at public rallies—a tactic dismissed by the major parties as irrelevant to electoral success, but one that underscores a hunger for unscripted political engagement. \"Farage understands something Sunak and Starmer seem to have forgotten: voters want to feel heard, not managed,\" said Dr. Hart. \"The tightly controlled, stage-managed events of the Conservatives and Labour feel sterile compared to the raw energy of a public rally, even if those rallies don’t always translate into seats.\"  Sunak’s campaign, in particular, has been criticized for its detachment from ordinary voters. His appearances have been carefully curated, often limited to scripted interviews or closed-door meetings, reinforcing the perception of a leader unwilling—or unable—to connect with the public. \"He talks about fighting for the country, but he won’t even step into a room full of voters who might challenge him,\" observed one disillusioned Conservative activist. \"That’s not leadership—it’s retreat.\"  As the election looms, the question is no longer whether Sunak can turn the tide, but whether his party can mitigate the scale of the impending defeat. With Labour maintaining a commanding lead in the polls and Reform chipping away at the Conservative base, the prime minister’s defiant rhetoric rings increasingly hollow. \"At this stage, it’s less about winning and more about survival,\" concluded Sylvester. \"And right now, even survival looks like a long shot.\"\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (1): The elderly man’s hands trembled slightly as he raised them beside his wife and granddaughter in the Conservative campaign ad—a staged tableau of surrender that ignited immediate backlash. \"It made my stomach turn,\" said Marcus Greenway, a retired teacher from Leeds, scrolling past the image on his phone. \"Using kids as political props? That’s a new low.\" The advertisement, captioned \"DON’T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY’S FUTURE TO LABOUR,\" has become emblematic of Rishi Sunak’s struggling campaign, where bold rhetoric collides with public skepticism.  Sunak’s defiant vow—\"I will never stop fighting for this country\"—has done little to shift the polls, which show Labour maintaining a 20-point lead nationally. In key battlegrounds like the Midlands and the so-called \"Blue Wall,\" Conservative support has eroded by 12-15% since 2019, according to YouGov. The prime minister’s troubles deepened after his early departure from D-Day commemorations—a decision that drew scorn even from traditional Tory voters. \"My dad stormed Juno Beach,\" said Sarah Whitmore, a small-business owner in Kent. \"To see Sunak treat remembrance like a scheduling conflict? That’s not leadership.\"  The controversial ad, criticized for its ambiguous but violent overtones, has split even Conservative ranks. \"It’s meant to symbolize Labour’s economic policies as a threat, not literal violence,\" insisted James Atherton, a local party chair in Surrey. But critics like Dr. Eleanor Hart of the University of Manchester countered: \"When you evoke imagery of families under duress, you’re not debating policy—you’re exploiting fear.\" The ad’s creators declined to comment, though a Tory insider admitted anonymously, \"We tested softer versions. The focus groups said they wouldn’t remember them.\"  Sunak’s challenges multiplied as the gambling scandal engulfed his campaign. Craig Williams, his parliamentary private secretary, is among those reportedly under police investigation for allegedly betting on the election date using insider knowledge. At a press conference, Sunak dodged questions about whether he’d disclosed the date to Williams, prompting legal expert Jonathan Fisher KC to remark: \"Transparency here wouldn’t prejudice an inquiry. Silence breeds distrust.\"  The parallels to England’s sputtering Euros campaign are unavoidable. \"Both Sunak and Southgate are trying to rally people who’ve stopped believing in them,\" noted football podcaster Liam Carter outside a London pub. Reform UK’s Nigel Farage, meanwhile, has drawn thousands to raucous rallies—a contrast to Sunak’s sterile, scripted appearances. \"Farage gets that politics should be visceral,\" said Hart. \"Sunak’s team treats voters like spreadsheet cells.\"  At a rare public Q&A in Bristol, the prime minister faced pointed questions about NHS wait times. \"He recited stats but didn’t *listen*,\" said attendee Fiona Briggs, a nurse. \"Like he’s on autopilot.\" With three weeks until polling day, even Conservative activists whisper about damage control. \"We’re not fighting for victory anymore,\" confessed one campaign staffer. \"We’re fighting to keep second place.\"  As the sun set on another day of dwindling momentum, Whitmore voiced a question haunting Tory strategists: \"If he’s fighting so hard, why does it feel like he’s already given up?\"\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): **Rishi Sunak’s Campaign in Crisis as Controversial Ad Backfires**  A Conservative campaign poster featuring an elderly man and his family with their hands raised—ostensibly surrendering to Labour—has sparked widespread condemnation, deepening Rishi Sunak’s electoral woes. Critics have slammed the imagery as exploitative, with one retired teacher branding it \"a new low\" in political messaging.  The ad, captioned *\"DON’T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY’S FUTURE TO LABOUR,\"* was intended to frame the election as a high-stakes battle. Instead, it has become a lightning rod for accusations of fearmongering. Polls show Labour maintaining a commanding 20-point lead, with Tory support eroding in traditional strongholds.  Sunak’s troubles have only compounded since his early departure from D-Day commemorations—a misstep that alienated even loyal Conservative voters. \"To treat remembrance like a scheduling conflict is indefensible,\" said one business owner whose father fought in Normandy.  Within Tory ranks, the ad has drawn mixed reactions. Some defend it as metaphorical, while experts warn it crosses a line. \"Evoking imagery of families under duress isn’t policy debate—it’s emotional manipulation,\" argued Dr. Eleanor Hart, a political analyst.  The prime minister’s campaign has also been rocked by a gambling scandal, with close aides under investigation for allegedly betting on the election date. Sunak’s refusal to clarify his own role has fueled accusations of opacity.  Meanwhile, Reform UK’s Nigel Farage is drawing enthusiastic crowds, contrasting sharply with Sunak’s scripted appearances. \"Farage understands the need for passion in politics,\" observed Hart. \"Sunak’s team treats voters like data points.\"  At a recent Q&A in Bristol, the prime minister faced tough questions on the NHS, with one attendee remarking, \"He recited numbers but didn’t connect.\" With the election looming, even Conservative insiders admit the focus has shifted from winning to limiting losses.  As Sunak’s campaign stumbles, the question lingers: If this is his idea of a fight, why does it feel like surrender?\n",
      "Self-Refine оценка (3): Here are the top 5 issues that make this article resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:    ### 1. **Overuse of Generic Quotations**      - **Issue:** Quotes like *\"a new low\"* and *\"He recited numbers but didn’t connect\"* feel formulaic and lack depth. Human journalists often seek more vivid, specific, or revealing statements from sources.      - **Suggestion:** Replace with more distinctive quotes that reveal personality, emotion, or unique insight (e.g., *\"It’s like they’re trying to scare my grandchildren into voting Tory—it’s pathetic\"*).    ### 2. **Excessive Use of \"Experts Say\" Framing**      - **Issue:** The attribution to Dr. Eleanor Hart (*\"argued Dr. Eleanor Hart, a political analyst\"*) follows a predictable LLM pattern of invoking an expert without contextualizing their credibility or relevance.      - **Suggestion:** Instead of generic titles, briefly explain why Hart’s perspective matters (e.g., *\"Hart, who has studied Conservative campaign tactics for a decade, noted...\"*).    ### 3. **Overly Balanced \"Some Say, Others Say\" Structure**      - **Issue:** The paragraph on Tory reactions (*\"Some defend it as metaphorical, while experts warn...\"*) reads like an AI-generated attempt at neutrality, lacking a clear narrative thrust.      - **Suggestion:** Prioritize the most compelling or consequential viewpoint rather than presenting a symmetrical debate. For example, emphasize internal dissent by naming specific MPs or campaign officials.    ### 4. **Predictable Rhetorical Flourishes**      - **Issue:** The closing line (*\"If this is his idea of a fight, why does it feel like surrender?\"*) is a clichéd, overly tidy wrap-up—common in LLM writing but rare in sharp journalism.      - **Suggestion:** End with a concrete detail (e.g., a voter’s reaction, a campaign insider’s quote) or a forward-looking question (e.g., *\"With three weeks left, even Sunak’s allies wonder: Can he reset the campaign—or is the damage irreversible?\"*).    ### 5. **Lack of Sensory or Observational Detail**      - **Issue:** The description of Farage’s crowds vs. Sunak’s scripted events is abstract (*\"drawing enthusiastic crowds\"\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (3): The Conservative Party's latest campaign poster—depicting an elderly man and his family with their hands raised in apparent surrender to Labour—has ignited a firestorm of criticism, further destabilizing Rishi Sunak's faltering election bid. The image, captioned *\"DON'T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY'S FUTURE TO LABOUR,\"* was meant to portray the election as an existential struggle, but instead has been widely condemned as a cynical ploy.  \"I've seen desperate tactics before, but this? It's like they're trying to scare my grandchildren into voting Tory,\" fumed Margaret Hargreaves, a 72-year-old former primary school headteacher from Surrey. \"My husband fought in the Falklands. He'd be sickened to see veterans used as political props.\"  The backlash compounds Sunak's mounting troubles, coming just weeks after his premature exit from D-Day commemorations—a decision that alienated core Conservative voters. \"My dad stormed Juno Beach at 19,\" said James Whitmore, owner of a Hampshire hardware store. \"For the PM to treat remembrance like a dentist appointment shows how disconnected they've become.\"  Internal Conservative divisions over the ad have erupted into open warfare, with three senior backbenchers privately describing it to reporters as \"tone-deaf\" and \"actively harmful.\" Only junior campaign staffers have publicly defended the imagery as \"metaphorical.\" Dr. Eleanor Hart, who has studied Conservative campaign tactics since the Cameron era, noted the party appears to be flailing: \"When you're reduced to stoking existential panic rather than debating policies, you've already lost the argument.\"  The gambling scandal engulfing Sunak's inner circle—with four aides under investigation for allegedly betting on the election date—has further eroded trust. The prime minister's evasive responses during a disastrous LBC interview last week left even sympathetic commentators exasperated.  Meanwhile, Nigel Farage's Reform UK rallies are drawing crowds that dwarf Sunak's stage-managed town halls. At a recent Bristol Q&A, the prime minister faced audible groans when reciting NHS waiting time statistics. \"It was like watching an accountant explain a spreadsheet to people whose mothers are stuck in hospital corridors,\" observed local nurse Sarah Chen, who attended the event.  With three weeks until polling day, Conservative strategists now speak privately of \"damage limitation\" rather than victory. One cabinet minister's aide put it bluntly: \"At this point, we're just trying to stop the bleeding before it becomes a hemorrhage.\"\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): The Conservative Party’s latest campaign poster—featuring an elderly man and his family with their hands raised like hostages in a bad action movie—has sparked outrage, further tanking Rishi Sunak’s already sinking election bid. The image, slapped with the melodramatic caption *\"DON’T SURRENDER YOUR FAMILY’S FUTURE TO LABOUR,\"* was supposed to scream *\"fight or die,\"* but instead just made everyone cringe.  Margaret Hargreaves, a 72-year-old retired headteacher from Surrey, squinted at the poster while absentmindedly stirring her tea with a biro. \"I’ve seen desperate tactics before, but this? It’s like they’re trying to scare my grandkids into voting Tory,\" she scoffed. \"My husband fought in the Falklands—he’d vomit if he saw veterans being used as political scarecrows.\" Behind her, a neighbor’s cat yowled for no discernible reason.  The backlash piles onto Sunak’s growing dumpster fire of bad decisions, fresh off his *\"I’ll just pop out early\"* D-Day exit. James Whitmore, who runs a hardware store in Hampshire (and owns at least seven identical flannel shirts), shook his head. \"My dad stormed Juno Beach at 19. For the PM to treat remembrance like a… uh… like a dentist appointment?\" He trailed off, staring at a cracked iPhone case on the counter. \"Yeah, it’s messed up.\"  Inside Tory HQ, chaos reigns. Three senior backbenchers privately called the ad *\"tone-deaf,\"* *\"actively harmful,\"* and—according to one—*\"the political equivalent of microwaving fish in the office.\"* Only junior staffers, probably hopped up on too much Red Bull, defended it as *\"metaphorical.\"* Dr. Eleanor Hart, who’s studied Conservative campaigns since the Cameron days, sighed. \"When you’re reduced to stoking panic instead of, y’know, having actual policies, you’ve already lost.\"  Meanwhile, the gambling scandal engulfing Sunak’s inner circle—four aides under investigation for allegedly betting on the election date like it’s the Grand National—has voters side-eyeing the party harder than a dodgy kebab. Sunak’s LBC interview last week was a masterclass in evasion, leaving even sympathetic pundits groaning. *\"Ain’t nobody got time for that,\"* muttered one radio producer off-air.  Over in Reform UK land, Nigel Farage’s rallies are pulling crowds that make Sunak’s town halls look like a poorly attended Tupperware party. At a recent Bristol Q&A, the PM got audible groans while reciting NHS stats. Local nurse Sarah Chen, who showed up mostly for the free biscuits, rolled her eyes. \"It was like watching an accountant explain a spreadsheet to people whose mums are stuck on gurneys. Also, the coffee was terrible.\"  With three weeks until polling day, Tory strategists have downgraded their ambitions from *\"victory\"* to *\"maybe don’t lose by a landslide.\"* One cabinet minister’s aide put it bluntly: \"Right now, we’re just slapping duct tape on the leaks before the whole ship goes under.\" Somewhere, a Conservative staffer dropped a stapler and didn’t bother picking it up. The metaphor writes itself.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (5): **Conservative Campaign Faces Backlash Over \"Hostage\" Poster and D-Day Missteps**  The Conservative Party’s latest campaign poster—depicting an elderly man and his family with their hands raised in a manner resembling hostages—has drawn sharp criticism, compounding the challenges facing Rishi Sunak’s faltering election campaign. The image, accompanied by the slogan *\"Don’t Surrender Your Family’s Future to Labour,\"* was intended to frame the election as a high-stakes battle but has instead been widely dismissed as alarmist and ineffective.  Public reaction has been overwhelmingly negative. Margaret Hargreaves, a 72-year-old retired headteacher from Surrey, described the poster as an attempt to \"frighten voters\" rather than engage them on policy. \"It’s beneath the dignity of a serious political party,\" she remarked. The controversy follows Sunak’s widely criticised early departure from D-Day commemorations, which further eroded confidence in his leadership.  James Whitmore, a Hampshire-based business owner, expressed dismay at the Prime Minister’s handling of the occasion. \"To treat such a solemn event with such disregard is deeply disappointing,\" he said.  Within Conservative ranks, frustration is mounting. Several senior figures privately dismissed the poster as \"misjudged\" and \"counterproductive,\" while campaign strategists reportedly struggle to regain momentum. Political analyst Dr. Eleanor Hart noted that the party appears to be relying on fear-based messaging rather than substantive policy proposals—a strategy she described as \"indicative of a campaign in trouble.\"  Meanwhile, the ongoing investigation into allegations that Conservative aides placed bets on the election date has further damaged the party’s credibility. Sunak’s recent media appearances, including an evasive interview on LBC, have done little to reassure voters or rally support.  In contrast, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage continues to draw large crowds, while Sunak’s public engagements have been met with visible scepticism. At a recent event in Bristol, audience members expressed frustration with the Prime Minister’s focus on statistics rather than direct engagement with concerns over public services.  With polling day approaching, Conservative strategists now appear focused on mitigating losses rather than securing victory. One aide admitted privately that the campaign is \"in damage-control mode,\" as internal morale continues to decline.  The coming weeks will determine whether the Conservatives can recover from these setbacks—or whether the party faces a significant electoral reckoning. \n",

       "['Good afternoon. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series,” Labour’s shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said today. “We’re not putting on politics as entertainment.” File this along with Keir Starmer’s offer of “realistic hope” and the Tories’ dark warnings of a Labour “supermajority” in your compendium of 2024’s vaulting campaign rhetoric. It’s been that sort of contest – and there is mounting evidence that voters are responding in kind.Gambling scandal | At least seven Metropolitan police officers are under investigation over the timing of bets, the London force said today. Meanwhile, the Gambling Commission said it was making “rapid progress” with its own investigation, and Rishi Sunak refused to say if he told his aide Craig Williams of the election date, citing the integrity of the inquiry process.Reform | A Reform candidate has been dropped after it emerged that he had been on a list of members of the British National party (BNP) in 2009. The party withdrew its support for Raymond Saint after the connection was brought to its attention by the Guardian, and accused Saint of failing to declare his BNP membership.Party funding | The number of people dragged into paying income tax has leapt by an estimated 4.4 million in three years because of the government’s freeze on thresholds, official data shows. The figures show that a continuing freeze on income tax thresholds, called a stealth tax by some, has pulled an extra 1.77 million pensioners into the income tax bracket.Analysis: ‘People have got bigger things to worry about’  One noticeable feature of last night’s bad-tempered debate was how both leaders chose to focus their closing statements – and where what seemed like their most passionate pitch to the public could be found. Sunak began by saying that he understood why people were frustrated with him and his party, before saying: “If you are not certain about Labour, don’t surrender to them. Don’t vote for any other party, vote Conservative.” Starmer, for his part, repeatedly said that if voters want change, “you have to vote for it”. Both men, in other words, were more concerned with the risks of apathy or protest votes than of persuading the undecided.Partly, that’s a function of where we are in the campaign: with a week to go, getting your own side to turn out becomes a more effective use of resources than finding new support from the middle. But the need to do so looks especially acute this time around. Most of the candidates’ interactions with voters have featured a certain amount of bad-tempered abuse, like audience member Robert Blackstock, who asked last night: “Are you two really the best we’ve got?” And in Hull East, Daniel Boffey heard from voters whose disenchantment with the political process matches roughly what reporters and pollsters have been hearing across the country. Sue Hurst, 78, said: “They tell you what they think you want to know – they treat us as stupid. You are born in hope and die in despair.”Members of the public treating the campaign period as an opportunity to have a go at the ruling class is nothing new, and these kinds of anecdotes don’t necessarily mean that it’s gotten worse. But there are factors around this election that seem to suggest an especially acute version of this. Prof Sir John Curtice gave the Independent a pithy summary: Two conditions are in place that suggest a low turnout. First the large poll lead so it looks as though it’s obvious what is going to happen. Second, there are only small differences between the two largest parties so it doesn’t matter much who wins anyway. To that we can add the fact that none of the main party leaders is popular or charismatic, which is why Farage can make waves.”More in Common asked people how their friends and family feel about the election – on the basis that most of us overrate our own level of political engagement when we are asked about it. In response, 41% said that their loved ones were more disillusioned this time around than previously; only a quarter said they thought the election could make a meaningful difference to the country.As you might expect, all this looks most damaging for the Conservatives. In this piece, Paula Surridge notes that only two-thirds of 2019 Conservative voters are certain to vote at this election, against 78% of 2019 Labour supporters and 72% of those who backed Lib Dems. But Labour are worried about it, too – or at least saying they are worried to keep rank and file members on their toes, and knocking doors. A memo to candidates sent by campaign chief Pat McFadden, reported by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg at the weekend, said that up to a quarter of voters are yet to make up their minds.In truth, even if that figure is right, they would have to break for the Tories in unprecedented numbers to close the gap. But Sunak’s favourite play of last night – beseeching voters not to “surrender” to Labour, a tactic repeated in a fairly reprehensible ad published this morning – suggests that the Tories hope they can gain more ground by scaring those flirting with Reform back into line. An unacknowledged byproduct is that messages of Tory doomerism may lead some Starmer supporters to conclude that they needn’t bother to show up.Even so, Labour keeps its vision deliberately constrained. The view from the Starmer camp is that the mood of disenchantment is precisely because of the big and broken promises of the Brexit era, and that the fulfilment of a more modest offer is the only way to win back public trust. There may be some truth to this – but it’s hard to pick apart without a counterfactual. A party with a bit more faith in the electorate’s imagination, after all, might have found itself on the brink of office with some actual goodwill, and a mandate for more than the most incremental kind of change. We’ll never know. As local MP Karl Turner told Daniel Boffey: “I think the big problem is if you’re in a low-wage economy, then people have got bigger things to worry about: paying the rents, paying the mortgages, looking after the family, feeding the kids. Going along to the polling station hardly matters.”What’s at stake  In New Forest West, Sir Desmond Swayne has one of the very safest Conservative seats in the country – and, although Swayne says he expects this to be the closest race he has contested in eight elections, most local voters tell Emily Dugan that they have no desire for a change. Betty Granger, 97, has her fingers crossed for a Tory win as she drinks tea at the New Milton Conservative Club: “I can’t think what anybody else would’ve done better,” she says of their record, and argues that the Conservatives are “the most sensible of the lot. Never has life been so good as when they’re in.”In the port town of Lymington, Emily visits the marina: At the Royal Lymington Yacht Club, John Macnamara, 76, is enjoying a glass of chilled white wine on the terrace. The retired oil and gas manager has already cast his postal vote so he can take his “beautiful” 33-foot sloop across the Channel to France, once the wind picks up. Low taxes are a priority and he has a 100% record of voting Conservative. He thinks “They haven’t done much to cover themselves in glory” this time – but he voted for them anyway. “Anyone very rich campaigning for Labour, there’s something wrong there,” he says.Winners of the day  Connoisseurs of hyperbole, after the Daily Telegraph’s Allister Heath – never shy of expressing his anguish at the state of the nation – outmatched even pieces about “Starmer’s sinister plan” and “1,000 hours to save Britain” with his latest: “Armageddon is upon us, and Britain will never be the same again”. “There are signs that Starmer understands the dangers of a drastic Left-wards tilt,” he notes a bit lower down, a fairly unusual thing to say of someone you accuse of precipitating the apocalypse.Losers of the day  Ravenous guard dogs in battleground seats, as canvassers wary of losing a finger in the line of duty hit on the ingenious precaution of using a spatula to poke leaflets through the letterbox.Quote of the day  Margaret: they’re taxing non-doms, not condoms.” A swing voter clears up a source of confusion to his partner after a Labour campaign visit in Hull East.',\n",
       " 'The political landscape in the UK has reached a fever pitch as the general election draws near, with both major parties scrambling to rally their bases while grappling with widespread voter disillusionment. Labour’s shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, set the tone early today by dismissing any notion that this campaign is about spectacle or entertainment. \"We’re not pitching you a new Netflix series,\" he quipped, underscoring Labour’s attempt to position itself as the party of sober, realistic governance. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Rishi Sunak has leaned into a darker narrative, warning of a looming Labour \"supermajority\" while urging voters not to \"surrender\" to change.  The campaign trail has been anything but smooth, marred by scandals and controversies that have only deepened public skepticism. The Metropolitan Police confirmed today that at least seven officers are under investigation for allegedly placing bets on the timing of the election—a scandal that has further eroded trust in institutions. The Gambling Commission, tasked with overseeing the inquiry, claims to be making \"rapid progress,\" but Sunak’s refusal to clarify whether he tipped off his aide, Craig Williams, about the election date has only fueled speculation.  Meanwhile, Reform UK found itself embroiled in another controversy after it emerged that one of its candidates, Raymond Saint, had been a member of the far-right British National Party (BNP) in 2009. The party swiftly withdrew its support, accusing Saint of failing to disclose his past affiliation—a move that underscores the heightened scrutiny minor parties face in this election.  On the economic front, official data reveals the growing burden of taxation on ordinary Britons. The government’s decision to freeze income tax thresholds has dragged an estimated 4.4 million more people into paying income tax over the past three years, including 1.77 million pensioners. Critics have branded the policy a \"stealth tax,\" arguing that it disproportionately impacts those least able to bear the financial strain.   Apathy and Anger on the Doorsteps  The mood among voters is one of deep frustration, a sentiment that was palpable during last night’s heated debate between Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer. Both leaders closed their arguments not with grand visions for the future, but with desperate pleas to their own supporters. Sunak framed the election as a last stand against Labour dominance, warning voters not to \"surrender\" to Starmer’s party. Starmer, in turn, hammered home the message that change only happens if people vote for it.  Their appeals reflect a grim reality: turnout is expected to be low, with many voters feeling that the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Polling expert Sir John Curtice summed it up succinctly, noting that the combination of Labour’s large lead and the perceived lack of meaningful policy differences between the major parties has left many wondering whether their vote even matters.  This disillusionment is evident in conversations with voters across the country. In Hull East, 78-year-old Sue Hurst captured the prevailing sentiment: \"They tell you what they think you want to know—they treat us as stupid. You are born in hope and die in despair.\" Such remarks highlight a broader erosion of faith in the political process, one that has been years in the making.  Labour’s cautious campaign strategy reflects an awareness of this skepticism. Party insiders argue that the public’s distrust stems from the grandiose, unfulfilled promises of the Brexit era, and that only a restrained, deliverable agenda can rebuild confidence. But critics counter that Labour’s reluctance to articulate a bold vision risks squandering an opportunity to inspire genuine enthusiasm.   The Tory Stronghold That Isn’t Budging  While much of the country appears ready for change, some constituencies remain firmly in the Conservative camp. In New Forest West, Sir Desmond Swayne, a veteran Tory MP, is confident of holding his seat despite acknowledging that this could be his toughest race yet. Local voters like 97-year-old Betty Granger, sipping tea at the New Milton Conservative Club, see no reason to switch allegiance. \"I can’t think what anybody else would’ve done better,\" she says of the Conservative record.  Even among wealthier voters, such as retired oil executive John Macnamara, the Tory brand retains its appeal. \"Low taxes are a priority,\" he admits, though he concedes that the party hasn’t \"covered itself in glory\" this time around. His vote, like many others in safe Tory seats, seems driven more by habit than conviction.   The Battle for Turnout  With polling day just a week away, both major parties are laser-focused on mobilizing their bases. Labour’s internal memos warn that up to a quarter of voters remain undecided—a figure that, if accurate, could still sway the outcome. However, given Labour’s commanding lead in the polls, even a late surge of undecided voters breaking for the Tories would likely fall short of altering',\n",
       " '1) Add more direct quotes from voters or political analysts to provide diverse perspectives.  2) Replace vague phrases like \"widespread voter disillusionment\" with specific examples or data points.  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive patterns (e.g., \"Meanwhile, X did Y\").  4) Include a stronger narrative hook in the opening paragraph to draw readers in.  5) Break up long paragraphs, especially in sections like \"Apathy and Anger on the Doorsteps,\" for better readability.  6) Add context or historical background to explain why voter disillusionment has grown over time.  7) Use more vivid, sensory details in descriptions (e.g., campaign events, voter reactions) to enhance emotional engagement.  8) Clarify ambiguous statements, such as \"tipped off his aide,\" with more precise language.  9) Introduce counterarguments or rebuttals to claims made by political figures for balanced reporting.  10) End with a forward-looking conclusion—what’s at stake or what to watch for—rather than trailing off.',\n",
       " 'The UK’s political landscape is simmering with tension as the general election approaches, revealing a nation deeply divided—not just between parties, but between engagement and apathy. On the streets of Hull East, 78-year-old Sue Hurst voices what polls and pundits have struggled to quantify: \"They tell you what they think you want to know—they treat us as stupid. You are born in hope and die in despair.\" Her words encapsulate the disillusionment shaping this election, where record-low turnout projections clash with the high stakes of economic strain and institutional scandals.  **Campaigns in Crisis Mode**  Labour and the Conservatives are running starkly different plays to counter voter fatigue. Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds set the tone early, dismissing flashy rhetoric: \"We’re not pitching you a new Netflix series,\" he told a crowd in Manchester, emphasizing Labour’s push for \"sober, deliverable policies.\" But critics argue the strategy lacks inspiration. \"Labour’s playing it safe to avoid past mistakes, but voters crave vision, not just damage control,\" says political analyst Maya Hobbs.  Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak’s campaign has taken a darker turn, framing the election as a defensive battle against a Labour \"supermajority.\" At a rally in Kent, he warned supporters not to \"surrender\" to change—a message that resonates unevenly. \"It feels less like a vision and more like fearmongering,\" remarked one undecided voter, echoing focus-group findings reported by *The Times*.  **Scandals and Distrust**  The Metropolitan Police’s confirmation that seven officers are under investigation for allegedly betting on the election date has further eroded public trust. The Gambling Commission claims \"rapid progress,\" but Sunak’s evasion on whether he tipped off aide Craig Williams about the date has fueled conspiracy theories. \"This isn’t just about bets—it’s about whether those in power play by their own rules,\" said Transparency UK’s director, Helen Flynn.  Reform UK, too, faced backlash after candidate Raymond Saint’s past BNP membership surfaced. The party cut ties, but the incident underscores the minefield of vetting in a polarized climate. \"Minor parties face microscope-level scrutiny while major parties get away with vague promises,\" argued Saint in a since-deleted social media post.  **The ‘Stealth Tax’ Backlash**  Economic discontent looms large. Official data shows 4.4 million more people—including 1.77 million pensioners—have been dragged into paying income tax due to frozen thresholds. \"Call it what it is: a stealth tax on ordinary people,\" said the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ Paul Johnson, noting the policy has boosted Treasury coffers by £44 billion since 2021. In Bristol, single mother Lisa Tran told reporters, \"Every year, my paycheck buys less. Politicians act like it’s inevitable, but it’s their choices doing this.\"  **The Turnout Dilemma**  With Labour leading by 20 points in polls, both parties are battling voter apathy. \"Low turnout helps incumbents, but this time, even Tory strongholds feel shaky,\" said polling expert Sir John Curtice. In New Forest West, 97-year-old Betty Granger sips tea at her local Conservative Club, unwavering in her support: \"I can’t think what anybody else would’ve done better.\" Yet nearby, retired oil executive John Macnamara admits his Tory vote is more habit than conviction: \"They haven’t covered themselves in glory.\"  **What’s Next?**  As the final week unfolds, the question isn’t just who will win, but how many will bother voting. Labour’s internal memos warn 25% of voters remain undecided—a pool large enough to shift marginal seats. But with Starmer avoiding bold pledges and Sunak relying on warnings, the deeper issue remains: after years of broken promises, can either party convince Britons that politics is worth believing in?  The answer may hinge less on policy than on whether voters, like Sue Hurst, still see a glimmer of hope behind the despair.',\n",
       " '- **Tone & Emotional Framing**: The original article maintains a wry, observational tone with measured skepticism (e.g., \"vaulting campaign rhetoric,\" \"reprehensible ad\"), while the generated version leans into dramatic urgency (\"simmering with tension,\" \"Armageddon is upon us\") and overt emotional appeals (\"born in hope and die in despair\").  \\n- **Narrative Structure**: The original weaves fragmented updates (gambling scandal, Reform candidate, tax thresholds) into a broader analysis of voter apathy, while the generated article reorganizes these elements into a more linear crisis-to-consequence arc, framing each issue as a symptom of systemic breakdown.  \\n- **Quote Realism**: Original quotes feel organic and context-specific (e.g., Betty Granger’s tea-club remark, the spatula leafleting anecdote), whereas generated quotes are streamlined for thematic impact (e.g., Lisa Tran’s \"Every year, my paycheck buys less\" feels like a composite economic grievance).  \\n- **Lexical Variety**: The original employs dry wit (\"connoisseurs of hyperbole,\" \"ravenous guard dogs\") and political insider shorthand (\"stealth tax,\" \"flirting with Reform\"), while the generated version favors accessible, emotive phrasing (\"dark turn,\" \"minefield of vetting\") and punchy soundbites (\"sober, deliverable policies\").  \\n- **Perspective Depth**: The original balances macro-analysis (Curtice’s turnout conditions, Surridge’s voter data) with micro-level color (yacht club retirees, Hull East disillusionment), whereas the generated article prioritizes sweeping statements about national mood, flattening granular details into broader strokes.',\n",
       " '**UK Election Campaign Stumbles Amid Scandals and Voter Discontent**  As Britain’s general election nears, the campaign trail has become a study in contrasts—between cautious messaging and voter disillusionment, between scandal and the struggle to cut through.  In Hull East, 78-year-old Sue Hurst sums up the mood with weary pragmatism: \"They tell you what they think you want to hear. After all these years, you learn not to expect much.\" Her skepticism mirrors broader trends, with polling suggesting turnout could hit record lows despite high stakes over the economy and public trust.  **Campaigns on the Defensive**  Labour’s strategy has been one of cautious discipline. Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds set the tone early, telling a Manchester crowd: \"This isn’t about slogans—it’s about showing up with credible plans.\" Yet critics argue the approach risks blending into the political wallpaper. \"Labour’s playing not to lose, but voters want something to vote *for*,\" notes political analyst Maya Hobbs.  Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak’s campaign has leaned heavily on warnings of a Labour \"supermajority,\" a tactic that has drawn mixed reactions. At a Kent rally, one undecided voter shrugged: \"It’s less a vision than a plea to hold your nose.\"  **Trust Under Scrutiny**  The Metropolitan Police’s confirmation that seven officers are being investigated for allegedly betting on the election date has deepened public cynicism. While the Gambling Commission insists progress is being made, Sunak’s refusal to clarify whether he tipped off aide Craig Williams about the date has fueled speculation. \"It’s the appearance of one rule for them, another for everyone else,\" said Helen Flynn of Transparency UK.  Reform UK, too, faced turbulence after candidate Raymond Saint’s past BNP links emerged—a reminder of the pitfalls for smaller parties under intense scrutiny. Saint, dropped by Reform, claimed in a since-deleted post that \"establishment parties get a free pass.\"  **The Frozen Thresholds Effect**  Economic grievances loom large, with 4.4 million more taxpayers—including 1.77 million pensioners—caught by frozen income tax thresholds since 2021. \"This is fiscal drag dressed up as fiscal responsibility,\" said the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ Paul Johnson. In Bristol, single mother Lisa Tran put it bluntly: \"Prices keep rising, but wages don’t. Nobody in Westminster seems to get it.\"  **The Apathy Factor**  With Labour’s poll lead holding steady, both parties face a turnout challenge. \"Low engagement traditionally helps incumbents, but this time, even Tory heartlands feel uncertain,\" observed polling expert Sir John Curtice. In New Forest West, 97-year-old Betty Granger remains a stalwart at her local Conservative Club (\"Who else is there?\"), while retired oil executive John Macnamara admits his Tory vote is more reflex than enthusiasm: \"They’ve not exactly covered themselves in glory.\"  As the final week unfolds, the campaign’s defining tension is clear: after years of upheaval, can either party persuade voters that politics—and voting—still matters? For now, the answer seems to hang in the balance, as much a question of trust as of policy.',\n",

Human-written journalism varies transitional phrasing more naturally.  \\n   - *Suggestion*: Replace with alternatives like \"Elsewhere,\" \"In contrast,\" or restructure sentences to avoid over-reliance on adverbs.  \\n\\n2. **Excessive Attribution of General Observations to Named Individuals**  \\n   - *Issue*: Quotes like Helen Flynn’s (\"one rule for them...\") or Paul Johnson’s (\"fiscal drag dressed up...\") state obvious critiques in a way that feels staged. Human journalists often paraphrase or reserve quotes for unique insights.  \\n   - *Suggestion*: Either paraphrase these generic statements or dig deeper for more distinctive quotes that reveal new information.  \\n\\n3. **Stilted Quote Integration**  \\n   - *Issue*: Quotes are often awkwardly wedged into sentences (e.g., \"Saint, dropped by Reform, claimed...\"). Human writers typically introduce speakers more fluidly or use standalone sentences.  \\n   - *Suggestion*: Break up clauses: \"Reform dropped Saint after the revelations. In a since-deleted post, he argued...\"  \\n\\n4. **Over-Explaining Context**  \\n   - *Issue*: Phrases like \"a reminder of the pitfalls for smaller parties under intense scrutiny\" or \"the appearance of one rule for them\" spell out implications unnecessarily. Human journalism trusts readers to infer subtext.  \\n   - *Suggestion*: Trim explanatory asides (e.g., just state Saint’s BNP links and let the reader connect the dots).  \\n\\n5. **Forced \"Balance\" in Anecdotes**  \\n   - *Issue*: The Betty Granger/John Macnamara pairing feels artificially symmetrical (stalwart vs. reluctant Tory). Human reporting might let one anecdote breathe or find less contrived contrasts.  \\n   - *Suggestion*: Choose the stronger anecdote or explore a more organic contrast (e.g., generational differences within the same demographic).  \\n\\n**Bonus Note**: The closing paragraph’s rhetorical question (\"can either party persuade voters...\") is a classic LLM trope.

       " 'The UK election campaign has become a messy collision of scandals, voter fatigue, and competing strategies as polling day looms—like a bad hangover nobody asked for. In Hull East, 78-year-old Sue Hurst, absentmindedly peeling the label off her lukewarm tea, voices what many seem to feel: \"They tell you, um, what they think you want to hear. Or maybe they don’t? Honestly, after all these years, you just... well, you learn not to expect much, I s’pose.\" Recent surveys suggest this disillusionment could drive turnout to historic lows, even with major economic issues at stake—though let’s be real, when has that ever stopped politicians from bickering over who left the fridge open in Westminster?  Labour\\'s carefully managed campaign has drawn criticism for playing it too safe—like a kid terrified of scraping their knee. At a Manchester rally, Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, adjusting his tie for the third time in five minutes, insisted the party was focused on \"credible plans, not slogans.\" But some analysts argue this caution comes at a cost. \"They\\'re so worried about making mistakes that they’ve basically turned into political wallpaper,\" says political commentator Maya Hobbs, pausing to sip from a chipped \"World’s Best Boss\" mug. \"Voters need to see, like, actual conviction? Not just a PowerPoint presentation with better fonts.\"  The Conservatives? Oh, they’ve got their own dumpster fire. Rishi Sunak’s warnings about a Labour \"supermajority\" have fallen flatter than a deflated soufflé. \"It’s not exactly inspiring,\" remarked one undecided voter in Kent, fiddling with the loose thread on her cardigan. \"More like begging us to settle for the lesser evil—which, let’s face it, ain’t nobody got time for that.\"  Public trust took another hit this week when the Metropolitan Police confirmed investigations into seven officers accused of betting on the election date—because nothing screams \"democracy in action\" like cops treating politics like a dodgy horse race. The scandal has raised uncomfortable questions about Westminster insiders potentially profiting from privileged info, while the rest of us just try to afford groceries. Transparency campaigners warn such incidents reinforce perceptions of a political class playing by different rules—shocking, right?  Reform UK also stumbled after dropping candidate Raymond Saint over his past links to the far-right BNP. In a since-deleted social media post, Saint accused mainstream parties of facing less scrutiny—which, coming from a guy with *that* baggage, was about as convincing as a chocolate teapot.  Economic pressures continue to dominate voter concerns. Frozen income tax thresholds have dragged 4.4 million more people into higher brackets since 2021, including nearly two million pensioners—who, let’s be honest, probably didn’t sign up for this financial rodeo. The Institute for Fiscal Studies describes this as \"stealth taxation,\" while Bristol resident Lisa Tran, balancing a wilting potted basil on her windowsill, puts it more plainly: \"Prices keep rising, but wages don’t. Nobody in Westminster seems to get it—or maybe they just don’t care?\"  With Labour maintaining a consistent lead in polls, both parties now grapple with voter apathy—the political equivalent of watching paint dry. \"Traditional Tory strongholds don’t feel safe anymore,\" notes polling expert Sir John Curtice, absentmindedly tapping his pen against a half-eaten Jaffa Cake. The contrast couldn’t be clearer than in New Forest West, where 97-year-old Betty Granger, clutching a decades-old Tory campaign leaflet like a sacred relic, remains a lifelong Conservative supporter, while retired executive John Macnamara admits his vote stems more from habit than enthusiasm—\"Like rewatching *Friends* for the hundredth time. Comfortable, but not exactly groundbreaking.\"  As the campaign enters its final stretch, the real battle may be convincing disillusioned voters that participation still matters—a challenge neither party has convincingly met.

       " '**UK Election Campaign Mired in Scandal and Voter Disillusionment**  As the UK general election approaches, the campaign has been overshadowed by growing voter apathy, political scandals, and strategic missteps from both major parties. With economic concerns dominating public discourse, analysts warn that disillusionment could lead to historically low turnout, despite high stakes for the country’s future.  ### **Labour’s Cautious Strategy Faces Criticism**  Labour has maintained a disciplined campaign, emphasising policy credibility over bold rhetoric. However, critics argue this approach risks appearing overly cautious. Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds recently defended the party’s strategy, stating it prioritises \"credible plans, not slogans.\" Yet political commentator Maya Hobbs suggests Labour’s risk-aversion may be counterproductive: \"Voters want conviction, not just polished presentations.\"  ### **Conservatives Struggle to Regain Momentum**  The Conservative campaign, meanwhile, has been hampered by internal divisions and a failure to inspire confidence. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s warnings of a Labour \"supermajority\" have failed to resonate, with some voters dismissing the argument as an appeal to fear rather than vision. One undecided voter in Kent remarked, \"It feels like we’re being asked to settle for the least bad option.\"  ### **Betting Scandal Fuels Distrust in Politics**  Public trust in politics suffered another blow this week as the Metropolitan Police confirmed investigations into seven officers accused of betting on the election date. The scandal has raised concerns about Westminster insiders potentially exploiting privileged information, reinforcing perceptions of a political class operating under different rules. Transparency campaigners warn such incidents deepen public cynicism at a time when faith in institutions is already fragile.  ### **Reform UK Faces Candidate Controversy**  Reform UK also encountered turbulence after dropping candidate Raymond Saint over past links to the far-right British National Party. Saint’s subsequent claim that mainstream parties face less scrutiny was met with scepticism, further complicating Reform’s efforts to position itself as a credible alternative.  ### **Economic Pressures Drive Voter Concerns**  Amid the political noise, economic hardship remains the dominant issue for many voters. Frozen income tax thresholds have pushed 4.4 million more people into higher tax brackets since 2021, including nearly two million pensioners—a trend the Institute for Fiscal Studies describes as \"stealth taxation.\" Bristol resident Lisa Tran summarised widespread frustration: \"Prices keep rising, but wages don’t. Nobody in Westminster seems to understand—or care.\"  ### **Apathy Threatens Election Turnout**  With Labour consistently ahead in polls, both parties now face the challenge of motivating disillusioned voters. Polling expert Sir John Curtice notes that traditional Conservative strongholds no longer feel secure, while many voters admit their choices are driven by habit rather than enthusiasm.  As the campaign enters its final phase, the key test for all parties will be convincing an increasingly disengaged electorate that participation still matters—a task neither has yet accomplished convincingly. The outcome may hinge on whether they can reignite public interest in a political landscape many feel has left them behind.']"
