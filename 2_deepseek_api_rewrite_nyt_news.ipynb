      "President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",
      "Новость номер 2:\n",
      "President Joe Biden faces an unrelenting storm of global crises, from the war in Ukraine to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Yet, according to those who know him best, one concern weighs heaviest on his mind: the legal battles of his son, Hunter Biden. As the younger Biden prepares to stand trial this week in Delaware on federal gun charges, the president has remained steadfast in his support, refusing to distance himself despite the political risks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The case centers on allegations that Hunter Biden lied about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018—a charge his legal team insists is politically driven. Legal experts note that such prosecutions are rare, raising questions about the timing and motivation behind the case. \"This is an unusual prosecution for what is typically treated as a paperwork violation,\" said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. \"Given the high-profile nature of the defendant, it’s hard not to see this as part of a broader political narrative.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "For the president, the trial is a deeply personal ordeal. Hunter’s struggles with addiction have been well-documented, and his legal troubles have shadowed the Biden family for years. Yet, rather than retreating, the president has drawn his son closer, as seen in recent public appearances—biking together in Delaware and attending church services. The two also gathered privately to commemorate the anniversary of Beau Biden’s death, a somber reminder of the family’s enduring grief.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The trial unfolds against a charged political backdrop. Just days ago, former President Donald Trump was convicted in a separate hush-money case, intensifying the partisan divide. Some analysts suggest the Hunter Biden case could galvanize Republican attacks, while others argue it may have little electoral impact. \"Voters tend to separate a candidate’s family issues from their policy decisions,\" said political strategist David Axelrod. \"But in a hyper-polarized environment, everything becomes fodder for the opposition.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "Friends and allies describe Hunter as resilient but strained. At a recent White House state dinner, when asked how he was holding up, he offered a subdued response: \"As best as possible.\" The remark underscores the emotional toll of the proceedings, not just on him but on his father, who must balance personal loyalty with the demands of the presidency.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As the trial begins, the Bidens brace for another chapter in a saga that has tested their family—and the nation’s political discourse—like few others.\n"

      "Ohio has moved to resolve a potential ballot crisis that threatened to leave President Joe Biden off the state’s November election ballot, with the Republican-controlled General Assembly passing a legislative fix that adjusts the certification deadline to align with the Democratic National Convention schedule. Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill into law this weekend following a final legal review, according to his office.   The issue arose after Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, also a Republican, warned that Biden could be excluded from the ballot because the Democratic Party’s official nomination process, set for August, would occur after Ohio’s August 7 deadline for certifying presidential candidates. This procedural conflict had raised concerns that Biden might not appear on the ballot in one of the nation’s key battleground states—a scenario that could have disrupted the electoral landscape.   Ohio has faced similar challenges in the past, with temporary extensions granted in 2012 for both President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and again in 2020 for then-President Donald Trump. Other states, including Alabama, have also adjusted their deadlines in recent months to accommodate both major parties’ convention schedules, demonstrating a bipartisan willingness to ensure ballot access for all qualified candidates.   However, the Ohio solution was nearly derailed by partisan disputes over an unrelated measure banning foreign contributions to state ballot initiatives. Republican lawmakers had initially tied the ballot deadline extension to this foreign influence provision, which Democrats opposed. The deadlock forced Governor DeWine to call a rare special session this week, urging legislators to act swiftly. “Leaders had a responsibility to address this urgent matter without delay,” DeWine stated.   The General Assembly ultimately passed two separate bills—one addressing the ballot deadline and another imposing the foreign donation ban. The latter measure, which includes restrictions on contributions from green card holders, has drawn criticism from immigrant advocacy groups but was praised by Senate President Matt Huffman as a necessary safeguard. “Ohioans deserve elections free from foreign interference, and we also had to ensure that every voter has access to a full ballot,” Huffman said in a statement.   Meanwhile, the Biden campaign had been preparing contingency plans, including a potential lawsuit and an early virtual roll-call vote by the Democratic National Committee to formally nominate Biden before Ohio’s original deadline. While the legislative fix appears to have resolved the issue, the DNC has confirmed that the virtual nomination process will proceed as a precaution.   Political analysts note that the episode underscores the fragility of election administration in a polarized climate. “What should have been a routine adjustment became a political battleground,” said Dr. Lisa Bryant, a political science professor at Kent State University. “This reflects broader tensions over election rules and the potential for procedural disputes to escalate.”   Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson, accused Ohio Republicans of using the situation to advance partisan agendas. “Instead of swiftly resolving a non-controversial issue, they chose to play games with voters’ rights,” she said.   With the bill’s expected signing, Ohio joins other states in ensuring ballot access for both major-party candidates, though the broader debate over election integrity and foreign influence in politics is likely to continue. The resolution also averts what could have been a significant legal and logistical challenge in a state that has played a decisive role in recent presidential elections.   Chris Cameron, a political reporter covering the 2024 race, contributed analysis on the legislative maneuvering and its implications for the upcoming election.\n",

      "The bill, which Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign this weekend, appeared to end the possibility that President Biden would not be on the state’s ballot in November. The Ohio General Assembly has passed a legislative fix that ensures President Biden will be on the state’s ballot in November, averting a crisis that had been brewing for weeks over what is typically a minor procedural issue. The secretary of state in Ohio, a Republican, had said that he planned to exclude Mr. Biden from the ballot because the president would not be officially nominated by his party until after a state deadline for certifying presidential nominees. That had threatened the possibility that the president would not be on the ballot in all 50 states. The General Assembly resolved the issue by passing a bill that pushes back the deadline to accommodate the date of the Democratic nominating convention. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill over the weekend, pending a legal review, according to a spokesman. The solution has been used before. Ohio passed temporary extensions to its certification deadline for President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 and for President Donald J. Trump in 2020. Other states that had similar deadline issues, including Alabama, have also passed legislative fixes with overwhelming bipartisan support, in 2024 and in other election cycles. But the solution proposed in the Ohio Legislature was entangled in a separate partisan clash over foreign donations. The General Assembly adjourned last week without a fix in place, after the Ohio Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, advanced a bill that would have resolved the issue but included a partisan measure banning foreign money in state ballot initiatives. Democrats opposed that measure, and the speaker of the Ohio House did not take it up before the chamber adjourned. Mr. DeWine then called a special legislative session to fix the problem, saying that legislators had failed “to take action on this urgent matter.” The General Assembly ultimately adopted two bills, one that fixed the ballot issue and another that banned donations in support of state ballot initiatives from foreign nationals, including immigrants with green cards. With the legislative solution appearing dead in the water last week, the Biden campaign considered suing the state to ensure that the president was on the ballot. Instead, the Democratic National Committee scheduled a virtual roll-call vote to officially nominate Mr. Biden ahead of the party’s convention in August. That vote is still set to go forward, even as the issue appears to be resolved. Hannah Muldavin, a spokeswoman for the committee, denounced what she called “partisan games” by Republican lawmakers that had delayed a solution. “Since the beginning of this process, Ohio Republicans have been playing partisan games and trying to chip away at our democracy, while Democrats have been defending Ohioans’ right to vote,” Ms. Muldavin said in a statement. Matt Huffman, the leader of the Ohio Senate, praised the foreign-influence ban, adding in a statement that Ohio “needed to ensure that President Biden is on the ballot in November, and it needed to be done legislatively.” Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.\n",

      "Following the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump on all 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records, a coordinated wave of misinformation has surged through conservative media circles and political allies. The verdict, delivered by a Manhattan jury after weeks of testimony, marked the first criminal conviction of a former U.S. president. Yet within hours, Trump denounced the proceedings as \"rigged\" while influential figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson and Fox News personalities amplified claims of judicial bias without evidence.  Legal scholars have pushed back against these assertions. \"Judges routinely oversee cases involving political figures without automatic recusal,\" explained Columbia Law professor Jessica Roth. \"The judicial ethics panel explicitly reviewed Justice Merchan's circumstances and found no conflict requiring him to step aside.\" The controversy stems from the judge's daughter working at Authentic Campaigns, a progressive digital firm, though ethics experts note family members' employment doesn't inherently create judicial conflicts.  The defense team's recusal motion last year triggered a formal review by New York's judicial ethics committee, which unanimously affirmed Merchan could preside fairly. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman noted, \"This wasn't some unilateral decision—it went through proper channels with bipartisan oversight.\" Court records show Trump's attorneys raised no objections to Merchan during jury selection, only attacking his impartiality after the unfavorable verdict.  Beyond the recusal claims, Trump allies have falsely asserted the case lacked precedent. In reality, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office has prosecuted over 30 business records falsification cases since 2022, including against non-political defendants. The Trump case uniquely involved amplifying the charges to felonies by connecting them to election law violations—a move some legal analysts consider aggressive but not unprecedented under New York penal code.  As appeals proceed, the rhetoric shows no signs of abating. \"This conviction will become a litmus test for GOP candidates,\" predicted political scientist Lara Brown, noting at least 15 congressional Republicans have pledged to investigate the prosecutors. Meanwhile, the court has set sentencing for July 11, where Trump faces potential probation to four years per count, though first-time offenders rarely receive maximum terms for such charges.\n",

      "After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty, he and a number of conservative figures in the news media and lawmakers on the right have spread false and misleading claims about the Manhattan case. After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, he instantly rejected the verdict and assailed the judge and criminal justice system. His loyalists in the conservative news media and Congress quickly followed suit, echoing his baseless assertions that he had fallen victim to a politically motivated sham trial. The display of unity reflected the extent of Mr. Trump’s hold over his base. The former president and his supporters have singled out the judge who presided over the case, denigrated the judicial system and distorted the circumstances of the charges against him and his subsequent conviction. Here’s a fact check of some of their claims. What Was Said “We had a conflicted judge, highly conflicted. There’s never been a more conflicted judge.”— Mr. Trump in a news conference on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan This is exaggerated. For over a year, Mr. Trump and his allies have said Justice Juan M. Merchan should not preside over the case because of his daughter’s line of work. Loren Merchan, the daughter, served as the president of a digital campaign strategy agency that has done work for many prominent Democrats, including Mr. Biden’s 2020 campaign. Experts in judicial ethics have said Ms. Merchan’s work is not sufficient grounds for recusal. When Mr. Trump’s legal team sought his recusal because of his daughter, Justice Merchan sought counsel from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which said it did not see any conflict of interest. \n",

      "President Biden welcomed the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House on Friday, celebrating their back-to-back Super Bowl victories with a mix of lighthearted camaraderie and subtle political messaging. The event provided a brief respite from a week dominated by weighty discussions on international conflict and domestic legal battles, including Biden’s renewed calls for peace in Gaza and reflections on the rule of law following former President Donald Trump’s criminal conviction.    Sporting a red Chiefs helmet to the delight of players and fans, Biden drew parallels between the team’s resilience and his own political challenges. \"Winning back-to-back—I kind of like that,\" he quipped, alluding to his upcoming rematch against Trump in November. \"When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.\" The remark underscored the high-stakes nature of his re-election campaign, which has been a central focus of his schedule amid a relentless string of campaign stops and diplomatic engagements.    While the event was a fleeting moment in Biden’s packed agenda—sandwiched between a meeting with Belgium’s prime minister and a weekend getaway to Rehoboth Beach—it carried undeniable star power. The Chiefs’ roster includes some of the NFL’s biggest names, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. However, one notable absence dimmed the spotlight: Taylor Swift, Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, was absent due to her ongoing European tour, having performed in Madrid just the night before.    The White House had previously deferred to the Chiefs on whether to extend an invitation to Swift, who has largely steered clear of overt political endorsements despite backing Biden in 2020. Her absence fueled speculation about whether she might weigh in on this year’s election, a move that could significantly influence voter engagement, particularly among younger demographics.    Adding another layer of intrigue to the event was the presence of Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who recently sparked controversy with a polarizing commencement speech at Benedictine College. His remarks, which touched on traditional gender roles and criticized certain cultural trends, drew both backlash and support, making his appearance at the White House a talking point in its own right.    Political analysts noted the balancing act at play—Biden’s attempt to leverage the cultural cachet of sports while navigating the complexities of celebrity influence in an election year. \"Events like these are about more than just celebration,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a professor of political communication at Georgetown University. \"They’re strategic opportunities to connect with voters in a relatable, nonpartisan setting—though the absence of figures like Swift reminds us that not all star power is easily harnessed.\"    As the Chiefs departed the South Lawn, the brief moment of festivity gave way to the realities of a president’s unrelenting schedule. Yet, for Biden, the visit underscored an enduring truth: in politics, as in sports, every public appearance is part of a larger game.\n",

      "Taylor Swift was not at the White House to celebrate with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, but kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew controversy for a commencement speech, attended. Reporting from the White House On Friday, President Biden urgently called for an end to the war in Gaza. He solemnly discussed the rule of law after former President Donald J. Trump’s criminal conviction. And he donned a shiny red helmet to the whoops and cheers of a pack of football players and fans. The visit to the White House by the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their second straight Super Bowl win gave the president a few moments of frivolity in a week replete with sobering events. “Winning back-to-back — I kind of like that,” Mr. Biden said, hinting at the tough re-election bid he faces in his rematch with Mr. Trump. He added, “When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.” The South Lawn celebration was a blip on the president’s schedule, squeezed between a meeting with the prime minister of Belgium and his weekend plans in Rehoboth Beach, Del., during a month with an endless string of campaign events. Yet, with some of the National Football League’s most famous names, it carried a certain celebrity wattage. Still, the spotlight was far dimmer than it could have been. Taylor Swift did not make the trip with her boyfriend, the star tight end Travis Kelce, as she was touring in Europe and had performed in Madrid on Thursday night. The White House had previously said it was up to the Chiefs whether to extend an invitation to the star musician, who has largely avoided embroiling herself in politics. She endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020, leading to speculation about whether she would do so again. \n",

      "Salem Media Group, a conservative media company, has issued a formal apology to Mark Andrews, a Georgia man who was falsely portrayed as engaging in election fraud in the controversial 2022 documentary *2,000 Mules*. The film, co-produced by Salem and directed by right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, alleged widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, claiming that \"mules\" working for Democratic operatives illegally stuffed ballot boxes in key swing states. The documentary, which grossed over $10 million and was viewed by more than a million people in its first two weeks, became a rallying cry for election conspiracy theorists despite lacking credible evidence.    Andrews, whose face was blurred in the film but clearly shown in promotional materials, was depicted in surveillance footage dropping multiple ballots into a drop box near Atlanta. D’Souza’s narration labeled the act as \"a crime\" and declared, \"These are fraudulent votes.\" However, Georgia state investigators later confirmed that Andrews had legally submitted ballots for himself and family members, following proper procedures.    Legal experts say the case highlights the dangers of misinformation in politically charged media. \"When documentaries blur the line between fact and fiction, they risk causing real harm to individuals and public trust,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a media ethics professor at the University of Georgia.    Andrews filed a defamation lawsuit in October 2022 against D’Souza, Salem Media Group, and members of the election-monitoring group True the Vote. The lawsuit alleges that the false portrayal damaged his reputation and subjected him to harassment. Legal analysts suggest the case could set a precedent for accountability in partisan media.    Salem’s apology comes amid growing scrutiny over the film’s claims, which have been repeatedly debunked by election officials and independent fact-checkers. Despite this, *2,000 Mules* continues to circulate in conservative circles, fueling ongoing skepticism about election integrity. The incident underscores the broader challenge of combating disinformation in an era where sensational claims often overshadow verified facts.    Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has consistently defended the state’s 2020 election results, reiterated that Andrews’ actions were lawful. \"Baseless accusations undermine faith in our democratic process,\" Raffensperger stated. \"It’s critical that media outlets verify claims before amplifying them.\"    As the legal proceedings unfold, the case serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of spreading unverified allegations in the name of political advocacy.\n",

      "Salem Media Group, which co-produced the 2022 film, issued the apology to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as stuffing a ballot box near Atlanta. The conservative media company Salem Media Group has apologized to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as having committed election fraud in the film “2,000 Mules,” which Salem co-produced and released in 2022. The documentary, written and directed by the right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, claimed that Democrats had conspired with nonprofit groups to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden by using “mules” who stuffed ballot boxes in swing states. More than a million people watched “2,000 Mules” in just the first two weeks after its release in May 2022, and the film grossed over $10 million. Its unfounded allegations became an article of faith for an untold number of Americans convinced that the election had been stolen. Five months later, Salem released a companion book. The film features surveillance video of the man from Georgia, Mark Andrews, as he places ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D’Souza calling the action “a crime” and adding, “These are fraudulent votes.” Although Mr. Andrews’s face is blurred in the images, the film’s producers used unblurred versions of the same video to promote the film on a variety of conservative news outlets, including Tucker Carlson’s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem. Mr. Andrews sued Mr. D’Souza, along with Salem and two individuals associated with the right-wing election-monitoring group True the Vote, for defamation in October 2022. State investigators in Georgia have since found that Mr. Andrews committed no crime and that he had legally deposited the ballots for himself and several members of his family. \n",

      "As the dust settles on Donald Trump’s historic felony conviction, Democrats across the country are grappling with how aggressively to weaponize the verdict in the 2024 presidential race. Interviews with more than 50 party leaders, strategists, and elected officials reveal a mix of enthusiasm and apprehension—a recognition that the conviction presents a rare political opportunity, but also deep concerns about whether President Joe Biden’s campaign can effectively capitalize on it.    Many Democrats argue that Trump’s legal troubles should dominate the narrative, framing him as unfit for office. \"This isn’t just about politics—it’s about preserving the integrity of our democracy,\" said former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who ran against Biden in the 2020 primary. \"Every voter needs to understand that the Republican nominee is now a convicted felon. That’s unprecedented in American history.\"    Yet, there’s no unified strategy on how forcefully to press the issue. Some worry that overemphasizing the conviction could backfire, energizing Trump’s base or shifting focus away from Biden’s policy achievements. Others fear the former president’s uncanny ability to deflect scandals, turning legal woes into rallying cries for his supporters.    Biden’s approach has been measured but deliberate. While he has largely avoided direct commentary on Trump’s legal battles, his campaign has grown bolder, recently labeling Trump a \"convicted felon\" in official statements—a rhetorical shift that signals a more confrontational phase ahead.    Political analysts suggest the conviction could sway undecided voters, particularly in swing states. \"For suburban independents and moderates, this could be a breaking point,\" said Dr. Amanda Hunter, a political science professor at Georgetown University. \"But Democrats can’t assume the verdict alone will sink Trump. They need a disciplined message tying his legal troubles to broader concerns about his fitness for office.\"    Behind the scenes, Democratic operatives are crafting ads, debate strategies, and stump speeches to ensure the conviction remains a focal point. Yet, with Trump’s sentencing still pending and appeals likely, the legal drama is far from over—and neither party can predict how it will ultimately reshape the race.    For now, Democrats are united in one belief: The stakes couldn’t be higher. \"This election isn’t just about policies—it’s about whether we normalize criminal behavior in our highest office,\" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. \"That’s a message we can’t afford to muff.\"\n",

      "Interviews with dozens of Democrats reveal a party hungry to tell voters that Donald Trump’s conviction makes him unfit for office, and hopeful that President Biden will lead the way. By Reid J. Epstein and Nicholas Nehamas Now that former President Donald J. Trump is a convicted criminal, the Democratic Party finds itself wrestling with a choice that will help define this year’s presidential race: Should it try to push his felonies to the center of the election? The route Democrats take may determine not only Mr. Biden’s fortunes but also, they say, the future of American democracy. Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernatural ability to survive even this political peril. Post-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — including current and former members of Congress, statewide elected officials, veteran strategists, Democratic National Committee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s conviction makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press that argument. “I do think it is the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is now a convicted felon and just how unprecedented this is,” said former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination against Mr. Biden in 2020. Even as Democrats broadly push Mr. Biden to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s felonies, there is a spectrum of opinion on just how much to focus on them.  Mr. Biden himself has deployed a two-pronged strategy, speaking carefully about Mr. Trump’s legal problems even as his campaign grows more aggressive: On Friday evening, it fired off an evening statement that referred, for the first time, to “Convicted Felon Donald Trump.” \n",

      "Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor embroiled in legal and financial turmoil, has faced mounting scrutiny over his financial disclosures amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. Five months after filing for Chapter 11 protection, it was revealed that one of his companies, Giuliani Communications, receives a steady income stream from a foundation honoring a firefighter who died in the September 11 attacks.    According to recent court filings, Giuliani’s online show, *America’s Mayor Live*, generates approximately $16,300 per month, with the majority of that revenue coming from the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The charity, established in memory of firefighter Stephen Siller, who perished while responding to the World Trade Center attacks, confirmed its sponsorship of Giuliani’s livestream and a now-defunct radio show. However, the foundation declined to disclose the total amount paid.    This financial connection had not been disclosed earlier in Giuliani’s bankruptcy case, prompting frustration among creditors who have long accused him of obscuring his assets. Legal experts say the omission could raise questions about transparency. \"Bankruptcy proceedings require full financial disclosure,\" said bankruptcy attorney Melissa Jacoby, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. \"Any undisclosed income, especially from a charitable organization, could complicate the case further.\"    Giuliani’s financial woes stem from a $148 million defamation judgment against him for spreading false claims about 2020 election workers, as well as indictments in Georgia and other legal battles tied to his efforts to overturn the election. Despite these challenges, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation has remained a financial backer, though its exact role in Giuliani’s broader financial picture remains unclear.    Creditors have also recently learned—through social media rather than official filings—that Giuliani had a separate deal promoting a branded coffee line. Such revelations have fueled skepticism about the completeness of his financial disclosures. \"Creditors have a right to know all sources of income to assess repayment possibilities,\" said bankruptcy specialist Jonathan Lipson of Temple University. \"Selective disclosure undermines the process.\"    The Tunnel to Towers Foundation, known for supporting first responders and military veterans, has not commented on whether it will continue its sponsorship. Legal analysts suggest that if the payments are deemed excessive or improperly documented, they could face further scrutiny. Meanwhile, Giuliani’s bankruptcy case remains contentious, with creditors pushing for greater transparency as they seek to recover funds from his dwindling assets.    As the case unfolds, the intersection of Giuliani’s political legacy, legal troubles, and financial entanglements continues to draw attention, raising broader questions about accountability in bankruptcy proceedings involving high-profile figures.\n",

      "Five months after filing for bankruptcy, the former New York City mayor disclosed his company’s income from a foundation established to honor a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. By David A. Fahrenthold and Eileen Sullivan Because of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been indicted in two states and hit with a $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek bankruptcy protection. Through all of that, he has kept a reliable financial ally: a charity founded to honor the memory of a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. The problem, according to his creditors’ lawyers, is that he has withheld that detail throughout his first five months of bankruptcy proceedings. In a filing last week, attorneys for Mr. Giuliani said that one of the former New York City mayor’s companies, Giuliani Communications, receives about $16,300 per month in income from his internet show “America’s Mayor Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s attorney said that money comes “mainly” from the Sept. 11 charity, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The revelation of the revenue stream comes after months of deeply contentious arguments from creditors about the state of Mr. Giuliani’s personal finances, with complaints that much of it remains deliberately incomplete and opaque. Only recently did creditors learn, through social media, that Mr. Giuliani had a contract to earn money from a new branded coffee line. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation confirmed that it sponsored both the livestream and Mr. Giuliani’s now-canceled radio show. The group declined to say how much it paid overall. \n",

      "The felony convictions of former President Donald J. Trump have deepened the political divide in America, leaving undecided voters grappling with whether his legal troubles will sway their decision in the upcoming election. Interviews conducted across key swing states—Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Iowa—reveal a stark polarization, with Trump's supporters dismissing the verdict as politically motivated while his critics see it as long-overdue accountability.    For many Republicans, the Manhattan trial, which found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, was nothing more than a partisan attack. Marty Lee, a 77-year-old from Scottsdale, Arizona, summed up the sentiment, calling the trial a \"kangaroo court\" and echoing Trump’s baseless claims of election interference. Legal experts, however, have repeatedly refuted such assertions, emphasizing that the jury’s unanimous decision was based on evidence presented in court.    On the other side, some Democrats, though relieved by the verdict, remain doubtful it will significantly alter the election’s outcome. Paula Doty, a 53-year-old teacher from Powers Lake, Wisconsin, expressed skepticism, saying, \"I don’t think it’s going to matter.\" Her sentiment reflects broader concerns that Trump’s loyal base remains unmoved, while swing voters may not see the conviction as a decisive factor.    Political analysts note that the verdict could still influence undecided or moderate voters, particularly in battleground states where margins are razor-thin. \"For voters who were on the fence, this introduces a new variable,\" said Dr. Evelyn Carter, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"But Trump’s ability to frame the narrative as persecution rather than justice may neutralize its impact.\"    Meanwhile, a small but notable shift has emerged among some independents. In Phoenix, 42-year-old small business owner Daniel Ruiz admitted the conviction gave him pause. \"I wasn’t thrilled about Biden, but this makes me reconsider,\" he said. Still, such voices remain rare, underscoring the entrenched nature of partisan loyalties.    As the election approaches, the question remains whether Trump’s legal woes will redefine the race or simply reinforce existing divisions. With both sides entrenched in their views, the verdict may ultimately serve as a rallying cry rather than a turning point.\n",

      "For the remaining undecided voters, the decision to pick former President Donald J. Trump could be more difficult now that he is a felon. By Jonathan WeismanKellen Browning and Maya King Jonathan Weisman reported from Bristol and Racine, Wis. Kellen Browning reported from Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz. Maya King reported from Philadelphia and Ardmore, Pa. As the nation’s electorate processed the felony convictions of Donald J. Trump, the partisan divide in the verdict’s wake did not look so much like opposing sides of a chasm but like two alternate universes, one where the former president had been hounded and persecuted by his corrupt political enemies, the other where justice had finally been served to a career criminal. Where the two sides were even within shouting distance of each other was vanishingly small, if it existed at all. But a few voices in the Trump universe allowed that Mr. Trump may well have done something wrong, and a few in the anti-Trump sphere said they had finally been convinced to vote for his opponent, President Biden. Dozens of interviews with voters in the swing states of Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as Iowa, found not a single supporter of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who had been pulled from his side by his conviction on 34 felony counts of fabricating business records to hide hush-money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election. Prosecutors had framed their case in the loftiest of terms, election interference — an all-out effort to thwart the exposure of a sex scandal that may well have changed the course of history. That was not how Mr. Trump’s supporters saw it. “I think that this was all a setup and rigged just like the election,” said Marty Lee, 77, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who was wearing a T-shirt that read “We the People Are Pissed Off.” The trial was “a kangaroo court,” he added. (False claims that the 2020 election was rigged, pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies, have been repeatedly debunked, and there is no basis for the suggestion that the Manhattan case or the verdict rendered unanimously by a jury of 12 was rigged.) Even Democrats were skeptical that the convictions would make a difference. “I’m cynical,” said Paula Doty, a 53-year-old teacher from Powers Lake, Wis., who applauded the verdict, “because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” “I’m cynical because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” Paula Doty, 53, Powers Lake, Wis. \n",

      "The political and legal saga surrounding former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani took another surreal turn as he marked his 80th birthday in a subdued celebration at an upscale Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. The event, held at Amata on East 56th Street, stood in stark contrast to the scene just blocks away, where former President Donald Trump basked in the spotlight at Trump Tower, boasting about a surge in campaign donations following his recent felony conviction.    Giuliani, once celebrated as \"America’s Mayor\" for his leadership after the 9/11 attacks, now faces a litany of legal and financial woes. His birthday gathering—featuring pasta and meatballs—was a far cry from the grandeur of his past public life. Earlier that day, he had been dealt another blow when a Washington, D.C. attorney disciplinary board recommended his disbarment, citing his role in spreading baseless election fraud claims. This came just weeks after he was indicted in Arizona for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results, adding to his existing charges in Georgia.    Financially, Giuliani is in dire straits. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and owes $148 million to two Georgia election workers he defamed. Despite his long-standing loyalty to Trump, the former president has done little to assist with his mounting legal bills. Instead, Giuliani has leaned on a 9/11 charity for financial support—a move that has drawn criticism from victims' advocates.    As he arrived at the restaurant, assisted by a security detail, the scene underscored his dramatic fall from grace. The venue, owned by the brother-in-law of his former chief of staff Anthony Carbonetti, offered a brief respite from his troubles. Meanwhile, Trump, in a video message played at the event, offered birthday wishes but no tangible aid—a symbolic reminder of Giuliani’s isolation in his legal battles. Legal experts suggest his predicament may worsen, with potential disbarment and further indictments looming. \"This is a cautionary tale of how political allegiance can lead to personal ruin,\" said one former federal prosecutor. \"Giuliani’s legacy is now overshadowed by his legal entanglements.\"    The evening’s subdued tone reflected the gravity of his situation—a far cry from the triumphant birthday bashes of his heyday.\n",

      "Campaign Notebook The indicted and increasingly isolated former New York mayor celebrated his birthday over pasta and meatballs. Donald J. Trump sent a video. Consider this Midtown split screen. Donald J. Trump on Friday appeared in the lobby of the gilded Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name to crow about the affection and campaign cash that have poured in since his conviction on 34 felonies. A few blocks away, at an Italian restaurant on East 56th Street, his former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was having a party for his 80th birthday. There was little to celebrate. Mr. Giuliani’s run-ins with the law have left his life and finances in tatters. As he left a previous party celebrating the same birthday, he was served notice of his indictment in an Arizona election-interference case. He has also been indicted in Georgia in connection to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Giuliani has filed for bankruptcy and owes two Georgia women a $148 million judgment from a defamation case. He is relying on a 9/11 charity as one of his last financial lifelines. Mr. Trump has done little to help with his legal bills. Earlier that very day, a board that oversees lawyer discipline in Washington recommended that Mr. Giuliani be disbarred. A little after 6 p.m., he stepped out of a Dodge Durango, helped along by a security detail, and into the restaurant, Amata, a white table-clothed, red-sauce joint owned by the brother-in-law of Anthony Carbonetti, the former mayor’s chief of staff at City Hall, who attended the party. \n",

      "A controversy has resurfaced in Montana surrounding Governor Greg Gianforte’s 2021 killing of a collared black wolf, with law enforcement officials now alleging they faced pressure to falsify records to protect the governor from legal consequences. The incident, initially dismissed as routine, has gained renewed attention as Gianforte seeks re-election amid growing scrutiny over wildlife ethics in the region.  Justin Hawkaluk, a former game warden with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP), recounted receiving an unusual request in March 2021—to officially document the governor’s kill of a wolf near Yellowstone National Park. While wolf hunting is legal in Montana, Hawkaluk sensed trouble from the start. \"I wanted no part of it,\" he told *The New York Times*, describing how his superiors later pressured him to shift blame to Gianforte’s hunting companion rather than the governor himself. The move, he claimed, was an attempt to shield Gianforte from receiving a citation for failing to complete a mandatory trapping education course.  The wolf, identified as No. 1155, had been tracked by Yellowstone researchers, adding another layer of controversy given the animal’s protected status under federal guidelines before its delisting in 2020. Gianforte’s office maintains that he corrected his oversight by taking the required course afterward, calling the allegations a politically motivated smear. \"The matter was handled no differently than it would have been for any other hunter,\" a department spokesperson said at the time.  But internal accounts suggest otherwise. Sources within FWP claim that officials, including Hawkaluk’s direct supervisor, pushed for irregularities in the reporting process. When Hawkaluk and his boss resisted, tensions escalated, ultimately leading to the supervisor’s forced resignation. Hawkaluk himself left the agency shortly after, disillusioned by what he described as a breakdown in ethical enforcement.   The case has drawn parallels to recent incidents, such as a Wyoming snowmobiler who taped a wolf’s mouth shut and paraded it in a bar before killing it—an act that reignited debates over wildlife treatment in the West. Conservation groups argue that such episodes reflect a broader disregard for ethical hunting practices, particularly among influential figures.   \"Public officials should be held to the highest standards, not given special treatment,\" said wildlife advocate Sarah McMillan of the Western Watersheds Project. \"When enforcement bends the rules for politicians, it erodes trust in the entire system.\"  As Gianforte’s re-election campaign gains momentum, opponents have seized on the wolf incident to question his commitment to ethical governance. Meanwhile, former FWP employees like Hawkaluk remain haunted by the fallout. \"I loved my job,\" he said. \"But I couldn’t stay after seeing how things were handled.\"   With Montana’s wolf management policies already contentious, the governor’s actions—and the alleged cover-up—have added fuel to a long-simmering debate over power, accountability, and wildlife conservation in the American West.\n",

      "Law enforcement officers say they were pressured to lie when Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana killed a black wolf in 2021. He says the story is an election-year smear. Jonathan Weisman reported from Missoula, Whitefish and Kalispell, Mont. The game warden in Helena, Mont., received a phone call one morning in March 2021 with a request that he knew might not end well for him. His boss and friend at the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department asked him to record officially the killing of a wolf, a fairly routine request save for one detail. The hunter was the state’s governor, Greg Gianforte. “I said I wanted no part of it,” the warden, Justin Hawkaluk, recalled with a barely audible chuckle. Mr. Hawkaluk now says his sense of dread was warranted. By the time the wolf affair was settled, his superiors had pressured him to lie about the governor’s role, and his boss would be forced out of the department, he told The New York Times in his first interview about the episode. He, too, would leave a job he said he loved. The story of the governor, the wolf and the warden made few waves when it first broke. Wolf hunting is legal and fairly common in Montana. Mr. Gianforte was recorded as the killer of the animal, an adult black wolf, and given a warning for not having taken a required trapping course. A spokeswoman for the governor said Mr. Gianforte had “immediately rectified the mistake” by taking the course. A spokesman for the department said at the time that the matter had been handled as it would have been for anyone. But Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, is running for re-election this year, and some find the killing of a once-protected species distasteful. The treatment of wolves is back in the news, after a snowmobiler in Wyoming struck one, taped its mouth shut and showed it off at a bar before killing it. Law enforcement officers involved with recording Mr. Gianforte’s wolf, collared as No. 1155 by trackers in nearby Yellowstone National Park, now say the procedures were anything put typical. They say that officials leaned on them to record the governor’s hunting buddy, rather than governor himself, as the shooter, in an attempt to avoid giving the governor a citation, and that the officials bristled when the warden and his boss refused. \n",

      "President Joe Biden faces an unrelenting storm of global crises, from the war in Ukraine to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Yet, according to those who know him best, one concern weighs heaviest on his mind: the legal battles of his son, Hunter Biden. As the younger Biden prepares to stand trial this week in Delaware on federal gun charges, the president has remained steadfast in his support, refusing to distance himself despite the political risks.    The case centers on allegations that Hunter Biden lied about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018—a charge his legal team insists is politically driven. Legal experts note that such prosecutions are rare, raising questions about the timing and motivation behind the case. \"This is an unusual prosecution for what is typically treated as a paperwork violation,\" said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. \"Given the high-profile nature of the defendant, it’s hard not to see this as part of a broader political narrative.\"    For the president, the trial is a deeply personal ordeal. Hunter’s struggles with addiction have been well-documented, and his legal troubles have shadowed the Biden family for years. Yet, rather than retreating, the president has drawn his son closer, as seen in recent public appearances—biking together in Delaware and attending church services. The two also gathered privately to commemorate the anniversary of Beau Biden’s death, a somber reminder of the family’s enduring grief.    The trial unfolds against a charged political backdrop. Just days ago, former President Donald Trump was convicted in a separate hush-money case, intensifying the partisan divide. Some analysts suggest the Hunter Biden case could galvanize Republican attacks, while others argue it may have little electoral impact. \"Voters tend to separate a candidate’s family issues from their policy decisions,\" said political strategist David Axelrod. \"But in a hyper-polarized environment, everything becomes fodder for the opposition.\"    Friends and allies describe Hunter as resilient but strained. At a recent White House state dinner, when asked how he was holding up, he offered a subdued response: \"As best as possible.\" The remark underscores the emotional toll of the proceedings, not just on him but on his father, who must balance personal loyalty with the demands of the presidency.    As the trial begins, the Bidens brace for another chapter in a saga that has tested their family—and the nation’s political discourse—like few others.\n",

      "President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",

      "Статья до изменений: President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",

      "итоговая статья: **Biden’s Most Personal Battle: As Hunter’s Gun Trial Begins, a Father’s Anguish Meets Political Firestorm**  President Joe Biden has navigated wars, economic turmoil, and a divided nation—but nothing cuts deeper than watching his son face a federal courtroom. This Monday, Hunter Biden will stand trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges of lying about his drug use when purchasing a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018. The case, which legal experts call an outlier for what’s often a minor administrative offense, has become a lightning rod in an election year already defined by courtroom drama.  “This isn’t just about a gun form—it’s about painting the Bidens as corrupt,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor. “Prosecutions like these are almost unheard of unless there’s an underlying violent crime.” Hunter’s legal team, led by attorney Abbe Lowell, argues the charges are selective enforcement, noting that the Justice Department rarely pursues standalone false-statement cases for first-time offenders.  The president’s response has been unwavering. At a recent fundraiser, Biden choked up when a donor asked about Hunter. “He’s the strongest person I know,” the president replied, according to two attendees. That bond was visible last month when father and son biked near their Delaware home, Hunter nodding to reporters but avoiding questions. Behind the scenes, friends say the president checks in daily. “There’s no daylight between them,” said Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and Delaware senator. “This family has weathered too much to let politics break them.”  The trial’s timing couldn’t be more volatile. Coming just weeks after Donald Trump’s felony conviction in New York, it’s ignited accusations of a two-tiered justice system. Republicans, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, claim the Delaware case only moved forward because of GOP pressure. “Where’s the accountability for the Big Guy?” Jordan tweeted last week, reviving unproven corruption allegations. Meanwhile, Trump allies like Steve Bannon are framing the trial as evidence of “Biden crime family” malfeasance—a narrative Democrats dismiss as desperate theatrics.  For Hunter, the proceedings reopen old wounds. His 2021 memoir, *Beautiful Things*, detailed his addiction spiral during the period he owned the gun. “I was smoking crack every 15 minutes,” he wrote. Recovery has been fragile; last summer, a plea deal on tax and gun charges collapsed after a judge questioned its terms. At April’s White House Easter Egg Roll, Hunter appeared gaunt but composed, telling a guest, “One day at a time”—a mantra familiar to anyone in recovery.  Legal analysts are split on the case’s implications. While convictions for similar offenses often result in probation, Hunter faces up to 25 years if sentenced consecutively. “The judge has wide discretion,” said former U.S. attorney Harry Litman. “But juries don’t love addicts being punished for relapse.”  The bigger question may be the political fallout. Polls show most voters don’t blame presidents for their adult children’s troubles, but Trump’s campaign is betting otherwise. “This trial keeps Hunter’s scandals in the headlines through the summer,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant. Democrats counter that the spectacle could backfire. “After Trump’s conviction, Republicans look hypocritical suddenly demanding ‘law and order’ for Hunter,” said Democratic operative Lis Smith.  As testimony begins June 3, the Bidens will confront a ritual they’ve endured since Beau’s death in 2015: private pain under public glare. The president isn’t expected in court, but aides say he’ll be watching—and waiting—for the moment his son walks out, free or otherwise. However it ends, one thing is certain: For a family that’s survived unimaginable loss, this trial is another test of resilience. And for a nation fatigued by division, it’s one more stress test of how justice and politics collide.\n"

      "Оригинальные статья: The bill, which Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign this weekend, appeared to end the possibility that President Biden would not be on the state’s ballot in November. The Ohio General Assembly has passed a legislative fix that ensures President Biden will be on the state’s ballot in November, averting a crisis that had been brewing for weeks over what is typically a minor procedural issue. The secretary of state in Ohio, a Republican, had said that he planned to exclude Mr. Biden from the ballot because the president would not be officially nominated by his party until after a state deadline for certifying presidential nominees. That had threatened the possibility that the president would not be on the ballot in all 50 states. The General Assembly resolved the issue by passing a bill that pushes back the deadline to accommodate the date of the Democratic nominating convention. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill over the weekend, pending a legal review, according to a spokesman. The solution has been used before. Ohio passed temporary extensions to its certification deadline for President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 and for President Donald J. Trump in 2020. Other states that had similar deadline issues, including Alabama, have also passed legislative fixes with overwhelming bipartisan support, in 2024 and in other election cycles. But the solution proposed in the Ohio Legislature was entangled in a separate partisan clash over foreign donations. The General Assembly adjourned last week without a fix in place, after the Ohio Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, advanced a bill that would have resolved the issue but included a partisan measure banning foreign money in state ballot initiatives. Democrats opposed that measure, and the speaker of the Ohio House did not take it up before the chamber adjourned. Mr. DeWine then called a special legislative session to fix the problem, saying that legislators had failed “to take action on this urgent matter.” The General Assembly ultimately adopted two bills, one that fixed the ballot issue and another that banned donations in support of state ballot initiatives from foreign nationals, including immigrants with green cards. With the legislative solution appearing dead in the water last week, the Biden campaign considered suing the state to ensure that the president was on the ballot. Instead, the Democratic National Committee scheduled a virtual roll-call vote to officially nominate Mr. Biden ahead of the party’s convention in August. That vote is still set to go forward, even as the issue appears to be resolved. Hannah Muldavin, a spokeswoman for the committee, denounced what she called “partisan games” by Republican lawmakers that had delayed a solution. “Since the beginning of this process, Ohio Republicans have been playing partisan games and trying to chip away at our democracy, while Democrats have been defending Ohioans’ right to vote,” Ms. Muldavin said in a statement. Matt Huffman, the leader of the Ohio Senate, praised the foreign-influence ban, adding in a statement that Ohio “needed to ensure that President Biden is on the ballot in November, and it needed to be done legislatively.” Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.\n",

      "The issue arose after Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, also a Republican, warned that Biden could be excluded from the ballot because the Democratic Party’s official nomination process, set for August, would occur after Ohio’s August 7 deadline for certifying presidential candidates.

      "However, the Ohio solution was nearly derailed by partisan disputes over an unrelated measure banning foreign contributions to state ballot initiatives.

      "Доработанная статья: **Ohio Averts Ballot Crisis as Legislature Extends Deadline for Biden’s Nomination**  COLUMBUS, Ohio—With just weeks to spare, Ohio lawmakers raced to prevent an unprecedented scenario: a November ballot without President Joe Biden’s name. Late Thursday, the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed an emergency bill to push back the state’s certification deadline, clearing the way for Biden to appear on the ballot after the Democratic National Convention in August. Governor Mike DeWine, who called a rare special session to break a partisan deadlock, is expected to sign the measure into law by the weekend.  “This was about doing what’s right for Ohio voters,” DeWine told reporters after the vote. “No one should be disenfranchised because of a technicality.”  The crisis began in April when Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, flagged a glaring conflict: The Democratic Party’s official nomination of Biden, scheduled for August 19–22, would miss Ohio’s August 7 certification cutoff by nearly two weeks. Without intervention, Biden’s name wouldn’t make the ballot in a state that has decided the last two presidential elections by single-digit margins.  “This wasn’t just a paperwork problem—it was a ticking clock,” said Franklin County Elections Director Antone White, who fielded calls from anxious voters. “People were asking, ‘Does this mean I won’t get to vote for the president?’”  Ohio has been here before. In 2012, lawmakers granted temporary extensions for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney when their conventions ran late. Similar fixes were made in 2020 for Donald Trump. This year, Alabama, Washington, and Illinois also adjusted deadlines to accommodate both parties. But in Ohio, what should have been a straightforward update nearly collapsed under the weight of partisan brinkmanship.  Republicans initially tied the deadline extension to an unrelated ban on foreign donations to state ballot initiatives—a move Democrats called a “poison pill.” The standoff forced DeWine to summon lawmakers back to the Capitol on Tuesday, where he scolded them for “playing with fire.”  By Thursday, the legislature had split the measures, passing the ballot fix as a standalone bill while approving the foreign contribution ban separately. The latter, which bars donations from green card holders and foreign entities, drew swift condemnation from immigration advocates but was defended by Senate President Matt Huffman as a “common-sense shield against outside influence.”  Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign had been preparing for the worst—exploring lawsuits and an early virtual nomination vote by the DNC to circumvent Ohio’s deadline. Though the legislative fix has likely rendered those plans unnecessary, the DNC confirmed it will proceed with a virtual roll call as a backup.  “This should never have been so difficult,” said Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson. “Republicans held Ohio voters hostage to pass an agenda they couldn’t get through on its own.”  The drama underscores how even mundane election procedures have become flashpoints in a hyper-polarized era. “Election administration used to be boring,” said Dr. Lisa Bryant, a Kent State political scientist. “Now, every deadline, every rule is a potential weapon. That’s dangerous for democracy.”  With the deadline extended, Ohio dodges a legal and logistical nightmare—but the broader fight over election rules is far from over. For voters like retired teacher Marcia Dunlap of Cincinnati, the resolution came as a relief. “It shouldn’t take a circus just to make sure our votes count,” she said. “But at least now, when I cast my ballot, I’ll know it’s complete.”  The fix ensures Ohio remains a full participant in what could be another razor-thin presidential race. And for election officials, it’s one less wildfire to put out in a year already brimming with them.  *Chris Cameron contributed reporting.*\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty, he and a number of conservative figures in the news media and lawmakers on the right have spread false and misleading claims about the Manhattan case. After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, he instantly rejected the verdict and assailed the judge and criminal justice system. His loyalists in the conservative news media and Congress quickly followed suit, echoing his baseless assertions that he had fallen victim to a politically motivated sham trial. The display of unity reflected the extent of Mr. Trump’s hold over his base. The former president and his supporters have singled out the judge who presided over the case, denigrated the judicial system and distorted the circumstances of the charges against him and his subsequent conviction. Here’s a fact check of some of their claims. What Was Said “We had a conflicted judge, highly conflicted. There’s never been a more conflicted judge.”— Mr. Trump in a news conference on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan This is exaggerated. For over a year, Mr. Trump and his allies have said Justice Juan M. Merchan should not preside over the case because of his daughter’s line of work. Loren Merchan, the daughter, served as the president of a digital campaign strategy agency that has done work for many prominent Democrats, including Mr. Biden’s 2020 campaign. Experts in judicial ethics have said Ms. Merchan’s work is not sufficient grounds for recusal. When Mr. Trump’s legal team sought his recusal because of his daughter, Justice Merchan sought counsel from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which said it did not see any conflict of interest. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Following the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump on all 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records, a coordinated wave of misinformation has surged through conservative media circles and political allies. The verdict, delivered by a Manhattan jury after weeks of testimony, marked the first criminal conviction of a former U.S. president. Yet within hours, Trump denounced the proceedings as \"rigged\" while influential figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson and Fox News personalities amplified claims of judicial bias without evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal scholars have pushed back against these assertions. \"Judges routinely oversee cases involving political figures without automatic recusal,\" explained Columbia Law professor Jessica Roth. \"The judicial ethics panel explicitly reviewed Justice Merchan's circumstances and found no conflict requiring him to step aside.\" The controversy stems from the judge's daughter working at Authentic Campaigns, a progressive digital firm, though ethics experts note family members' employment doesn't inherently create judicial conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defense team's recusal motion last year triggered a formal review by New York's judicial ethics committee, which unanimously affirmed Merchan could preside fairly. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman noted, \"This wasn't some unilateral decision—it went through proper channels with bipartisan oversight.\" Court records show Trump's attorneys raised no objections to Merchan during jury selection, only attacking his impartiality after the unfavorable verdict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the recusal claims, Trump allies have falsely asserted the case lacked precedent. In reality, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office has prosecuted over 30 business records falsification cases since 2022, including against non-political defendants. The Trump case uniquely involved amplifying the charges to felonies by connecting them to election law violations—a move some legal analysts consider aggressive but not unprecedented under New York penal code.\n",
      "\n",
      "As appeals proceed, the rhetoric shows no signs of abating. \"This conviction will become a litmus test for GOP candidates,\" predicted political scientist Lara Brown, noting at least 15 congressional Republicans have pledged to investigate the prosecutors. Meanwhile, the court has set sentencing for July 11, where Trump faces potential probation to four years per count, though first-time offenders rarely receive maximum terms for such charges.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: The Manhattan courtroom fell silent as the jury foreperson stood to deliver the verdict—34 guilty counts ringing out one after another in rapid succession. For the first time in U.S. history, a former president had been convicted of felony crimes. But before the ink could dry on the court documents, Donald Trump's supporters launched a full-throated assault on the justice system itself.  \"Total witch hunt!\" Trump declared to cameras outside the courthouse, his face flushed with anger as supporters chanted in the background. Within hours, the misinformation machine roared to life. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed without evidence that Judge Juan Merchan had \"coached\" the jury, while Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that the prosecution was \"Soros-funded lawfare\"—a false assertion repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers.  Legal experts swiftly countered the attacks. \"Judges don’t step aside just because a defendant happens to be a politician,\" said Columbia Law professor Jessica Roth, who reviewed the case. \"If that were the standard, no high-profile defendant would ever face trial.\" The backlash focused on Merchan’s daughter working at a progressive digital firm, but ethics panels—including a bipartisan New York judicial committee—had already vetted and approved his impartiality.  \"Let’s be clear: Trump’s team had every chance to challenge this judge earlier,\" former federal prosecutor Harry Litman told reporters. \"They didn’t object during jury selection. Only after losing did they suddenly cry foul.\"  The misinformation didn’t stop there. Trump allies insisted the case was unprecedented—ignoring that Manhattan prosecutors have brought over 30 business falsification cases in recent years. One such case involved a restaurant owner who doctored records to hide cash payments from employees. Another targeted a real estate developer who, like Trump, allegedly inflated asset values to secure loans. The key difference? Prosecutors tied Trump’s actions to election interference, elevating misdemeanors to felonies—a controversial but legally permissible move.  As the July 11 sentencing date looms, the political fallout intensifies. At a rally in Arizona, Trump supporter Linda Michaels, 62, called the verdict \"an attack on all of us.\" Meanwhile, GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson vow to retaliate, promising congressional investigations into the prosecutors.  Legal analysts note that while Trump faces up to four years per count, first-time offenders in similar cases typically receive probation. But the real battle isn’t just in the courts—it’s in the court of public opinion, where facts and falsehoods now wage an all-out war.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Taylor Swift was not at the White House to celebrate with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, but kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew controversy for a commencement speech, attended. Reporting from the White House On Friday, President Biden urgently called for an end to the war in Gaza. He solemnly discussed the rule of law after former President Donald J. Trump’s criminal conviction. And he donned a shiny red helmet to the whoops and cheers of a pack of football players and fans. The visit to the White House by the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their second straight Super Bowl win gave the president a few moments of frivolity in a week replete with sobering events. “Winning back-to-back — I kind of like that,” Mr. Biden said, hinting at the tough re-election bid he faces in his rematch with Mr. Trump. He added, “When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.” The South Lawn celebration was a blip on the president’s schedule, squeezed between a meeting with the prime minister of Belgium and his weekend plans in Rehoboth Beach, Del., during a month with an endless string of campaign events. Yet, with some of the National Football League’s most famous names, it carried a certain celebrity wattage. Still, the spotlight was far dimmer than it could have been. Taylor Swift did not make the trip with her boyfriend, the star tight end Travis Kelce, as she was touring in Europe and had performed in Madrid on Thursday night. The White House had previously said it was up to the Chiefs whether to extend an invitation to the star musician, who has largely avoided embroiling herself in politics. She endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020, leading to speculation about whether she would do so again. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: President Biden welcomed the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House on Friday, celebrating their back-to-back Super Bowl victories with a mix of lighthearted camaraderie and subtle political messaging.

      "\n",
      "Sporting a red Chiefs helmet to the delight of players and fans, Biden drew parallels between the team’s resilience and his own political challenges. \"Winning back-to-back—I kind of like that,\" he quipped, alluding to his upcoming rematch against Trump in November. \"When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.\" The remark underscored the high-stakes nature of his re-election campaign, which has been a central focus of his schedule amid a relentless string of campaign stops and diplomatic engagements.  \n",

However, one notable absence dimmed the spotlight: Taylor Swift, Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, was absent due to her ongoing European tour, having performed in Madrid just the night before.  \n",

      "The White House had previously deferred to the Chiefs on whether to extend an invitation to Swift, who has largely steered clear of overt political endorsements despite backing Biden in 2020. Her absence fueled speculation about whether she might weigh in on this year’s election, a move that could significantly influence voter engagement, particularly among younger demographics.  \n",

      "Доработанная статья: The roar of \"Chiefs Kingdom\" chants echoed across the White House South Lawn Friday as President Biden fumbled with a red helmet before finally securing it on his head—drawing cheers from players and laughter from quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \"Don't worry, Mr. President,\" Mahomes shouted over the crowd, \"took me three seasons to figure out how to wear mine right too!\"  Under a blazing June sun, about 2,000 fans and staff watched Biden welcome the back-to-back Super Bowl champions in what became part victory lap, part campaign stop. The president leaned into football metaphors throughout his 12-minute speech, drawing clear parallels between the Chiefs' underdog story and his own political fight. \"When people wrote you off after that rough September start?\" Biden said, pointing to Mahomes. \"Sound familiar? I know a little something about being counted out.\"  The event's lighthearted atmosphere—complete with Biden joking about wanting Travis Kelce's biceps—couldn't completely mask its political undertones. Political strategists noted the careful choreography: the championship trophy placed just so behind the presidential podium, the navy blue backdrop dotted with red and gold Chiefs logos. \"Every frame matters in an election year,\" said veteran Democratic operative Maria Cardona, watching from the press pen. \"This wasn't just a photo op—it was a values contrast with Trump's divisive rallies.\"  One conspicuous absence drew more attention than any attendee: Taylor Swift, currently mid-European tour, left a noticeable gap in the team's star power. White House staffers confirmed to NBC News they'd deferred to the Chiefs on guest invitations, though Kelce later told reporters, \"She's got her own kingdom to rule right now\" when asked about Swift's missing presence. The pop star's absence fueled fresh speculation about whether she'll repeat her 2020 Biden endorsement, with Gen Z voters particularly attuned to her potential influence.  The event took an unexpected turn when kicker Harrison Butker—fresh off controversy for his traditionalist commencement speech—received a mix of boos and cheers during introductions. Nearby, two fans wearing \"Butker 2028\" shirts clashed verbally with a group of women in Mahomes jerseys who turned their backs during his appearance. \"We're here for football, not sermons,\" said Kansas City teacher Lisa Yang, 34, who traveled for the event.  Political communication expert Dr. Emily Carter of Georgetown observed the tightrope walk in real time: \"Biden needs sports' unifying appeal, but these cultural flashpoints—Swift's absence, Butker's presence—show how today's athletes carry more baggage than just shoulder pads.\" As Marine One's blades began whirring overhead, signaling Biden's next engagement, Kelce could be heard joking with staffers: \"Guess we're not getting that White House sleepover after all.\" The remark—equal parts playful and revealing—captured the day's delicate dance between celebration and calculation.\n",

The conservative media company Salem Media Group has apologized to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as having committed election fraud in the film “2,000 Mules,” which Salem co-produced and released in 2022. The documentary, written and directed by the right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, claimed that Democrats had conspired with nonprofit groups to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden by using “mules” who stuffed ballot boxes in swing states. More than a million people watched “2,000 Mules” in just the first two weeks after its release in May 2022, and the film grossed over $10 million. Its unfounded allegations became an article of faith for an untold number of Americans convinced that the election had been stolen. Five months later, Salem released a companion book. The film features surveillance video of the man from Georgia, Mark Andrews, as he places ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D’Souza calling the action “a crime” and adding, “These are fraudulent votes.” Although Mr. Andrews’s face is blurred in the images, the film’s producers used unblurred versions of the same video to promote the film on a variety of conservative news outlets, including Tucker Carlson’s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem. Mr. Andrews sued Mr. D’Souza, along with Salem and two individuals associated with the right-wing election-monitoring group True the Vote, for defamation in October 2022. State investigators in Georgia have since found that Mr. Andrews committed no crime and that he had legally deposited the ballots for himself and several members of his family. \n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Interviews with dozens of Democrats reveal a party hungry to tell voters that Donald Trump’s conviction makes him unfit for office, and hopeful that President Biden will lead the way. By Reid J. Epstein and Nicholas Nehamas Now that former President Donald J. Trump is a convicted criminal, the Democratic Party finds itself wrestling with a choice that will help define this year’s presidential race: Should it try to push his felonies to the center of the election? The route Democrats take may determine not only Mr. Biden’s fortunes but also, they say, the future of American democracy. Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernatural ability to survive even this political peril. Post-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — including current and former members of Congress, statewide elected officials, veteran strategists, Democratic National Committee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s conviction makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press that argument. “I do think it is the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is now a convicted felon and just how unprecedented this is,” said former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination against Mr. Biden in 2020. Even as Democrats broadly push Mr. Biden to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s felonies, there is a spectrum of opinion on just how much to focus on them.  Mr. Biden himself has deployed a two-pronged strategy, speaking carefully about Mr. Trump’s legal problems even as his campaign grows more aggressive: On Friday evening, it fired off an evening statement that referred, for the first time, to “Convicted Felon Donald Trump.” \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: As the dust settles on Donald Trump’s historic felony conviction, Democrats across the country are grappling with how aggressively to weaponize the verdict in the 2024 presidential race. Interviews with more than 50 party leaders, strategists, and elected officials reveal a mix of enthusiasm and apprehension—a recognition that the conviction presents a rare political opportunity, but also deep concerns about whether President Joe Biden’s campaign can effectively capitalize on it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Many Democrats argue that Trump’s legal troubles should dominate the narrative, framing him as unfit for office. \"This isn’t just about politics—it’s about preserving the integrity of our democracy,\" said former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who ran against Biden in the 2020 primary. \"Every voter needs to understand that the Republican nominee is now a convicted felon. That’s unprecedented in American history.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, there’s no unified strategy on how forcefully to press the issue. Some worry that overemphasizing the conviction could backfire, energizing Trump’s base or shifting focus away from Biden’s policy achievements. Others fear the former president’s uncanny ability to deflect scandals, turning legal woes into rallying cries for his supporters.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Biden’s approach has been measured but deliberate. While he has largely avoided direct commentary on Trump’s legal battles, his campaign has grown bolder, recently labeling Trump a \"convicted felon\" in official statements—a rhetorical shift that signals a more confrontational phase ahead.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Political analysts suggest the conviction could sway undecided voters, particularly in swing states. \"For suburban independents and moderates, this could be a breaking point,\" said Dr. Amanda Hunter, a political science professor at Georgetown University. \"But Democrats can’t assume the verdict alone will sink Trump. They need a disciplined message tying his legal troubles to broader concerns about his fitness for office.\"  \n",

      "Доработанная статья: The moment the guilty verdict was read in a Manhattan courtroom last week, the Democratic war room sprang into action. Within hours, the Biden campaign blasted fundraising emails with the subject line: \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\" By morning, digital ads featuring the words \"Guilty on All Counts\" in bold red type flooded battleground state social media feeds.  \"It’s not every day your opponent gets convicted of 34 felonies,\" said Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who’s helping coordinate rapid-response efforts. \"We’re going to make sure voters never forget it—from now until November.\"  Interviews with dozens of Democratic officials, strategists, and voters reveal a party energized by Trump’s unprecedented legal downfall but wrestling with how hard to press their advantage. While some see the conviction as a silver bullet, others warn against overplaying their hand in what remains a volatile political climate.  \"Look, I’ll say it plainly—a felon shouldn’t be president,\" declared former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland at a union hall rally in Cleveland, drawing cheers. But moments later, he cautioned: \"We can’t just run on ‘Lock him up’ chants. People care about their paychecks and prescription costs too.\"  The Biden campaign’s approach reflects this tension. Though the president himself has avoided gloating—his only public comment being a restrained \"the American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed\"—his team has gone on offense. New battleground state ads contrast Biden’s infrastructure projects with footage of the verdict announcement, while debate prep teams are reportedly crafting zingers branding Trump as \"the convicted candidate.\"  Republican operatives are already countering. \"This is banana republic stuff,\" Trump adviser Jason Miller told Fox News, claiming the conviction has triggered a flood of small-dollar donations. At a MAGA rally in Phoenix, the crowd broke into chants of \"Trump 2024!\" as the former president vowed to appeal, calling the case \"election interference.\"  Recent polling suggests the verdict may move the needle. A CNN survey found 50% of registered voters approve of the conviction, including 16% of Republicans. But strategists note the real test will come in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where focus groups show suburban women expressing fresh doubts about Trump.  \"These voters weren’t going to Trump anyway, but the conviction makes them less likely to stay home,\" said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. \"The danger for Republicans is it becomes cumulative—the verdict plus January 6 plus the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape creates a ‘too much baggage’ perception.\"  With sentencing set for July 11—just days before the GOP convention—the legal drama is far from over. Democratic attorneys general in several states are exploring whether the conviction affects ballot access, while Republican legislatures rush to pass resolutions condemning the trial.  At a Detroit diner, nurse practitioner Claire Williamson summed up the split-screen moment: \"I’ve never seen anything like this—a former president with a rap sheet while running again. It feels like we’re living in a history book, and not a good chapter.\"  As both campaigns recalibrate, one thing is clear: The 2024 election just entered uncharted territory.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Five months after filing for bankruptcy, the former New York City mayor disclosed his company’s income from a foundation established to honor a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. By David A. Fahrenthold and Eileen Sullivan Because of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been indicted in two states and hit with a $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek bankruptcy protection. Through all of that, he has kept a reliable financial ally: a charity founded to honor the memory of a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. The problem, according to his creditors’ lawyers, is that he has withheld that detail throughout his first five months of bankruptcy proceedings. In a filing last week, attorneys for Mr. Giuliani said that one of the former New York City mayor’s companies, Giuliani Communications, receives about $16,300 per month in income from his internet show “America’s Mayor Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s attorney said that money comes “mainly” from the Sept. 11 charity, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The revelation of the revenue stream comes after months of deeply contentious arguments from creditors about the state of Mr. Giuliani’s personal finances, with complaints that much of it remains deliberately incomplete and opaque. Only recently did creditors learn, through social media, that Mr. Giuliani had a contract to earn money from a new branded coffee line. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation confirmed that it sponsored both the livestream and Mr. Giuliani’s now-canceled radio show. The group declined to say how much it paid overall. \n",

The latest twist? A nonprofit honoring a fallen 9/11 firefighter has been quietly bankrolling his media ventures.  Court documents reveal that Giuliani’s struggling livestream show, *America’s Mayor Live*—a mix of election conspiracy theories and interviews with fringe figures—relies heavily on the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which covers roughly $16,300 of its monthly $17,000 revenue. The charity, named for a firefighter who died rushing into the Twin Towers, confirmed it sponsored both the show and a short-lived radio program. \"We supported content highlighting first responders and veterans,\" said foundation CEO Frank Siller, Stephen’s brother, though he declined to specify total payments.  The sponsorship, undisclosed in Giuliani’s bankruptcy filings until now, has ignited fury among creditors. \"This isn’t just oversight—it’s a pattern,\" argued a lawyer for the Georgia election workers who won the massive defamation verdict against Giuliani for falsely accusing them of ballot fraud. Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the mother-daughter duo targeted by his claims, saw their lives upended by threats; their legal team now questions whether charitable funds helped bankroll Giuliani’s legal defenses.  Bankruptcy experts say the omission could carry consequences. \"Courts demand total transparency—especially when a debtor’s income comes from a 9/11 charity,\" said UNC law professor Melissa Jacoby. Giuliani’s attorneys counter that all income streams were properly reported, blaming delays on \"logistical hurdles.\"  But creditors smell smoke. They recently discovered—via Giuliani’s Instagram, not court papers—that he’d struck a deal with *Rudy.Coffee*, a conservative-branded coffee line hawking \"Fighting for Justice\" blends. The venture’s revenue remains murky, much like the $200,000 in \"consulting fees\" Giuliani allegedly pocketed from a mystery client last year.  For Tunnel to Towers, the arrangement risks reputational fallout. The foundation, which builds smart homes for disabled veterans, now faces awkward questions about subsidizing a figure entangled in election lies. \"Donors trust us to honor heroes, not fund political operatives,\" one longtime supporter grumbled anonymously.  As Giuliani’s assets dwindle—his Manhattan condo recently listed for $6.5 million—the bankruptcy battle grows fiercer. With creditors demanding forensic accounting and legal fees mounting, the man who once stood atop Ground Zero’s rubble finds himself buried in liabilities, his financial maze still revealing new turns.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: For the remaining undecided voters, the decision to pick former President Donald J. Trump could be more difficult now that he is a felon. By Jonathan WeismanKellen Browning and Maya King Jonathan Weisman reported from Bristol and Racine, Wis. Kellen Browning reported from Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz. Maya King reported from Philadelphia and Ardmore, Pa. As the nation’s electorate processed the felony convictions of Donald J. Trump, the partisan divide in the verdict’s wake did not look so much like opposing sides of a chasm but like two alternate universes, one where the former president had been hounded and persecuted by his corrupt political enemies, the other where justice had finally been served to a career criminal. Where the two sides were even within shouting distance of each other was vanishingly small, if it existed at all. But a few voices in the Trump universe allowed that Mr. Trump may well have done something wrong, and a few in the anti-Trump sphere said they had finally been convinced to vote for his opponent, President Biden. Dozens of interviews with voters in the swing states of Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as Iowa, found not a single supporter of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who had been pulled from his side by his conviction on 34 felony counts of fabricating business records to hide hush-money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election. Prosecutors had framed their case in the loftiest of terms, election interference — an all-out effort to thwart the exposure of a sex scandal that may well have changed the course of history. That was not how Mr. Trump’s supporters saw it. “I think that this was all a setup and rigged just like the election,” said Marty Lee, 77, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who was wearing a T-shirt that read “We the People Are Pissed Off.” The trial was “a kangaroo court,” he added. (False claims that the 2020 election was rigged, pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies, have been repeatedly debunked, and there is no basis for the suggestion that the Manhattan case or the verdict rendered unanimously by a jury of 12 was rigged.) Even Democrats were skeptical that the convictions would make a difference. “I’m cynical,” said Paula Doty, a 53-year-old teacher from Powers Lake, Wis., who applauded the verdict, “because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” “I’m cynical because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” Paula Doty, 53, Powers Lake, Wis. \n",

      "Доработанная статья: The muggy courtroom in Manhattan had barely adjourned when the political earthquake hit. For the first time in U.S. history, a former president stood convicted of felony crimes—34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. The verdict didn't just land like a legal bombshell; it tore open fresh fault lines in an already fractured electorate, sending shockwaves through diners, living rooms, and campaign offices across swing states.In Scottsdale, Arizona, Marty Lee's hands trembled with anger as he slammed his coffee cup onto the Formica counter of his local diner. \"This whole trial was a damn kangaroo court,\" the 77-year-old retiree spat, his face flushing crimson. Like many Trump supporters interviewed, Lee dismissed the unanimous jury verdict as election interference—a claim legal experts from both parties have repeatedly debunked. \"They've been trying to take him down since 2016,\" Lee added, jabbing his finger at a Fox News broadcast playing above the bar.But in a Powers Lake, Wisconsin classroom, 53-year-old teacher Paula Doty paused while grading papers to process the news. \"It's about damn time someone held him accountable,\" she told me, though her relief was tempered by pragmatism. She leaned forward, lowering her voice as if sharing a state secret: \"But let's be real—his people won't care. They'll just dig in deeper.\"The emotional whiplash reflects America's polarized reality. According to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 67% of Democrats say the conviction makes them less likely to support Trump, while 64% of Republicans say it makes no difference to their vote. But it's the narrow slice of undecided voters—about 7% of the electorate, per Pew Research—that could tip the scales in battleground states.\"For voters who were genuinely torn, this introduces a new calculus,\" explained Dr. Evelyn Carter, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who studies voter behavior. She noted that key evidence—like Trump's own handwritten notes about reimbursements to Michael Cohen—could resonate differently with various demographics. \"College-educated suburban women might see this as disqualifying, while working-class voters may view it through an economic lens.\"Legal scholars point to damning testimony from former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and the paper trail of doctored invoices as particularly compelling evidence. \"This wasn't a he-said-she-said case,\" noted NYU law professor Rachel Barkow. \"The smoking guns were in the documents.\"Yet in Phoenix, small business owner Daniel Ruiz embodied the conflicted middle. The 42-year-old independent voter paced outside his auto repair shop, wiping grease from his hands as he wrestled with the news. \"I wasn't excited about Biden,\" he admitted, \"but a convicted felon? That's... something.\" His voice trailed off as a customer's truck rumbled into the bay.The conviction's electoral impact remains uncertain, but its legal ripple effects are already unfolding. Trump faces three more criminal cases—including federal charges over classified documents and January 6-related allegations—though delays may push those trials past Election Day. Meanwhile, both campaigns are retooling their messaging, with Trump fundraising off his \"persecution\" narrative and Democrats testing ads highlighting the verdict.As the dust settles, one thing seems clear: In a nation where politics has become tribal, even historic convictions may not change minds so much as harden positions. The real verdict will come not from twelve jurors in Manhattan, but from millions of voters this November—many of whom appear to have already rendered their judgment.\n",

Consider this Midtown split screen. Donald J. Trump on Friday appeared in the lobby of the gilded Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name to crow about the affection and campaign cash that have poured in since his conviction on 34 felonies. A few blocks away, at an Italian restaurant on East 56th Street, his former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was having a party for his 80th birthday. There was little to celebrate. Mr. Giuliani’s run-ins with the law have left his life and finances in tatters. As he left a previous party celebrating the same birthday, he was served notice of his indictment in an Arizona election-interference case. He has also been indicted in Georgia in connection to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Giuliani has filed for bankruptcy and owes two Georgia women a $148 million judgment from a defamation case. He is relying on a 9/11 charity as one of his last financial lifelines. Mr. Trump has done little to help with his legal bills. Earlier that very day, a board that oversees lawyer discipline in Washington recommended that Mr. Giuliani be disbarred. A little after 6 p.m., he stepped out of a Dodge Durango, helped along by a security detail, and into the restaurant, Amata, a white table-clothed, red-sauce joint owned by the brother-in-law of Anthony Carbonetti, the former mayor’s chief of staff at City Hall, who attended the party. \n",

      "Доработанная статья: Rudy Giuliani’s 80th birthday party should have been a victory lap—a toast to the man once hailed as \"America’s Mayor.\" Instead, the dimly lit back room of Amata, an upscale Italian eatery in Midtown Manhattan, felt more like a wake. Between plates of handmade pappardelle and veal saltimbocca, the disgraced former mayor held court with a handful of loyalists, his security detail hovering nearby. Just blocks away, Donald Trump held court at Trump Tower, crowing about a post-conviction fundraising surge. The contrast couldn’t have been starker.  \"Happy birthday, Rudy!\" Trump’s prerecorded video message blared from a screen, offering cheer but no check—a hollow gesture for a man drowning in legal bills. Giuliani chuckled weakly, according to two attendees, but the weight of the day was inescapable. Hours earlier, a D.C. attorney disciplinary board had recommended his disbarment over his relentless promotion of 2020 election lies. It was just the latest blow: Arizona prosecutors indicted him last month for election interference, adding to his Georgia racketeering charges.  \"Rudy’s living scene-by-scene now,\" said a longtime associate, swirling a glass of Barolo. \"One minute he’s joking about the old days, the next he’s staring into space like he’s tallying up the damages.\" Those damages are staggering—$148 million owed to defamed Georgia election workers, bankruptcy filings, and a 9/11 charity controversially covering his bills. \"It’s tragic,\" the associate added. \"The guy who stood in the wreckage at Ground Zero can’t afford his own lawyers.\"  Yet some allies remain defiant. \"This is political persecution,\" insisted Ted Goodman, Giuliani’s spokesperson, as espresso cups clinked around him. \"They’re criminalizing dissent.\" Legal analysts aren’t convinced. \"The disciplinary board’s decision is a professional death sentence,\" said former federal prosecutor Mimi Rocah. \"But the real question is whether he’ll face prison time in Georgia or Arizona.\"  As the night wound down, Giuliani posed for photos beneath Amata’s vaulted brick arches—a venue chosen not for its Michelin stars, but because it’s owned by his ex-chief of staff’s brother-in-law. The cake arrived, candles flickering. For a moment, the room sang. Then the lights came up, the cameras turned off, and Giuliani shuffled out into the Manhattan night—alone with his mounting consequences.  The birthday boy’s wish? Probably the same one he’s had since 2020: a legal Hail Mary. But as the indictments pile up, even Rudy must know the clock’s running out.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Law enforcement officers say they were pressured to lie when Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana killed a black wolf in 2021. He says the story is an election-year smear. Jonathan Weisman reported from Missoula, Whitefish and Kalispell, Mont. The game warden in Helena, Mont., received a phone call one morning in March 2021 with a request that he knew might not end well for him. His boss and friend at the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department asked him to record officially the killing of a wolf, a fairly routine request save for one detail. The hunter was the state’s governor, Greg Gianforte. “I said I wanted no part of it,” the warden, Justin Hawkaluk, recalled with a barely audible chuckle. Mr. Hawkaluk now says his sense of dread was warranted. By the time the wolf affair was settled, his superiors had pressured him to lie about the governor’s role, and his boss would be forced out of the department, he told The New York Times in his first interview about the episode. He, too, would leave a job he said he loved. The story of the governor, the wolf and the warden made few waves when it first broke. Wolf hunting is legal and fairly common in Montana. Mr. Gianforte was recorded as the killer of the animal, an adult black wolf, and given a warning for not having taken a required trapping course. A spokeswoman for the governor said Mr. Gianforte had “immediately rectified the mistake” by taking the course. A spokesman for the department said at the time that the matter had been handled as it would have been for anyone. But Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, is running for re-election this year, and some find the killing of a once-protected species distasteful. The treatment of wolves is back in the news, after a snowmobiler in Wyoming struck one, taped its mouth shut and showed it off at a bar before killing it. Law enforcement officers involved with recording Mr. Gianforte’s wolf, collared as No. 1155 by trackers in nearby Yellowstone National Park, now say the procedures were anything put typical. They say that officials leaned on them to record the governor’s hunting buddy, rather than governor himself, as the shooter, in an attempt to avoid giving the governor a citation, and that the officials bristled when the warden and his boss refused. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: A controversy has resurfaced in Montana surrounding Governor Greg Gianforte’s 2021 killing of a collared black wolf, with law enforcement officials now alleging they faced pressure to falsify records to protect the governor from legal consequences. The incident, initially dismissed as routine, has gained renewed attention as Gianforte seeks re-election amid growing scrutiny over wildlife ethics in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justin Hawkaluk, a former game warden with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP), recounted receiving an unusual request in March 2021—to officially document the governor’s kill of a wolf near Yellowstone National Park. While wolf hunting is legal in Montana, Hawkaluk sensed trouble from the start. \"I wanted no part of it,\" he told *The New York Times*, describing how his superiors later pressured him to shift blame to Gianforte’s hunting companion rather than the governor himself. The move, he claimed, was an attempt to shield Gianforte from receiving a citation for failing to complete a mandatory trapping education course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wolf, identified as No. 1155, had been tracked by Yellowstone researchers, adding another layer of controversy given the animal’s protected status under federal guidelines before its delisting in 2020. Gianforte’s office maintains that he corrected his oversight by taking the required course afterward, calling the allegations a politically motivated smear. \"The matter was handled no differently than it would have been for any other hunter,\" a department spokesperson said at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But internal accounts suggest otherwise. Sources within FWP claim that officials, including Hawkaluk’s direct supervisor, pushed for irregularities in the reporting process. When Hawkaluk and his boss resisted, tensions escalated, ultimately leading to the supervisor’s forced resignation. Hawkaluk himself left the agency shortly after, disillusioned by what he described as a breakdown in ethical enforcement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The case has drawn parallels to recent incidents, such as a Wyoming snowmobiler who taped a wolf’s mouth shut and paraded it in a bar before killing it—an act that reignited debates over wildlife treatment in the West. Conservation groups argue that such episodes reflect a broader disregard for ethical hunting practices, particularly among influential figures. \n",

      "As Gianforte’s re-election campaign gains momentum, opponents have seized on the wolf incident to question his commitment to ethical governance.

      "Доработанная статья: **Montana Governor’s Wolf-Killing Controversy Reignites as Election Nears**  Beneath the snow-dusted ridges just north of Yellowstone National Park, a collared black wolf—known to researchers as No. 1155—prowled the Lamar Valley in early 2021. The 98-pound male, part of Yellowstone’s Junction Butte Pack, had been monitored for years, its movements logged by biologists studying the park’s iconic predators. But on February 15, 2021, its GPS signal went dark. Days later, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte posed for photos with the wolf’s carcass, a kill he later described as a legal hunt.  Now, three years later, explosive allegations from within Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) suggest the incident was anything but routine. Former game warden Justin Hawkaluk claims agency leaders pressured him to falsify records to protect Gianforte from potential legal consequences—a charge that has resurfaced as the governor campaigns for re-election amid mounting scrutiny over wildlife ethics in the West.  \"I knew something was off the minute I got the call,\" Hawkaluk told *The New York Times*, recalling the March 2021 request to document the governor’s kill. Though wolf hunting is legal in Montana, Gianforte had failed to complete a mandatory trapping education course before taking the animal—a violation that typically results in a citation. Instead, Hawkaluk says his superiors instructed him to pin the lapse on Gianforte’s hunting companion, a move he refused. \"I wanted no part of it,\" he said.  The wolf’s history deepened the controversy. No. 1155 had been federally protected until 2020, when the Trump administration delisted gray wolves in the Northern Rockies. Yellowstone biologists, who’d tracked the animal since 2018, expressed dismay at its death just outside park boundaries. \"This was a wolf that helped us understand pack dynamics,\" said wildlife biologist Dr. Nathan Varley, who studies Yellowstone’s predators. \"Its loss is more than a statistic—it’s a blow to ongoing research.\"  Gianforte’s office has dismissed the allegations as a political attack, emphasizing that the governor retroactively completed the required course. \"The matter was handled no differently than it would have been for any other hunter,\" FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon said in 2021. But internal accounts reveal a far messier reality. Hawkaluk’s direct supervisor, who also resisted altering the report, was forced to resign shortly after the incident. Hawkaluk left the agency months later, disillusioned. \"I loved my job,\" he said. \"But I couldn’t stay after seeing how things were handled.\"  Had Gianforte been cited, he could have faced a fine up to $500 and a potential suspension of his hunting privileges—a minor penalty, critics note, but one that would have carried symbolic weight. \"Public officials should be held to the highest standards, not given special treatment,\" said Sarah McMillan of Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group. The case has drawn comparisons to recent incidents, like a Wyoming man who taped a wolf’s mouth shut and displayed it in a bar before killing it—acts that have galvanized outrage over unethical wildlife practices.  Meanwhile, Gianforte’s supporters dismiss the uproar as partisan noise. \"This is a non-issue drummed up by opponents who don’t understand Montana’s hunting heritage,\" said state Rep. Steve Gunderson, a Republican. But the timing is awkward for the governor, who has championed expanded wolf-hunting quotas—a policy applauded by ranchers but condemned by conservationists.  As the election nears, the story of Wolf 1155 has become a rallying cry for Gianforte’s critics. Protesters gathered outside the state capitol in Helena last week, waving signs reading \"Accountability for All.\" Online, the hashtag #WolfGate has trended among Montana voters, with even some hunters expressing unease. \"Ethics shouldn’t end where politics begin,\" tweeted Bozeman outfitter Mark Baker.  For Hawkaluk, the fallout lingers. \"This wasn’t just about a wolf,\" he said. \"It was about who gets to bend the rules—and who pays the price.\" With Montana’s wolf management already a lightning rod, the governor’s actions have reignited a decades-old debate over power, transparency, and what it means to steward the West’s wildest places.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",

      "Доработанная статья: **Biden’s Most Personal Battle: As Hunter’s Gun Trial Begins, a Father’s Anguish Meets Political Firestorm**  President Joe Biden has navigated wars, economic turmoil, and a divided nation—but nothing cuts deeper than watching his son face a federal courtroom. This Monday, Hunter Biden will stand trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges of lying about his drug use when purchasing a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018. The case, which legal experts call an outlier for what’s often a minor administrative offense, has become a lightning rod in an election year already defined by courtroom drama.  “This isn’t just about a gun form—it’s about painting the Bidens as corrupt,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor. “Prosecutions like these are almost unheard of unless there’s an underlying violent crime.” Hunter’s legal team, led by attorney Abbe Lowell, argues the charges are selective enforcement, noting that the Justice Department rarely pursues standalone false-statement cases for first-time offenders.  The president’s response has been unwavering. At a recent fundraiser, Biden choked up when a donor asked about Hunter. “He’s the strongest person I know,” the president replied, according to two attendees. That bond was visible last month when father and son biked near their Delaware home, Hunter nodding to reporters but avoiding questions. Behind the scenes, friends say the president checks in daily. “There’s no daylight between them,” said Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and Delaware senator. “This family has weathered too much to let politics break them.”  The trial’s timing couldn’t be more volatile. Coming just weeks after Donald Trump’s felony conviction in New York, it’s ignited accusations of a two-tiered justice system. Republicans, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, claim the Delaware case only moved forward because of GOP pressure. “Where’s the accountability for the Big Guy?” Jordan tweeted last week, reviving unproven corruption allegations. Meanwhile, Trump allies like Steve Bannon are framing the trial as evidence of “Biden crime family” malfeasance—a narrative Democrats dismiss as desperate theatrics.  For Hunter, the proceedings reopen old wounds. His 2021 memoir, *Beautiful Things*, detailed his addiction spiral during the period he owned the gun. “I was smoking crack every 15 minutes,” he wrote. Recovery has been fragile; last summer, a plea deal on tax and gun charges collapsed after a judge questioned its terms. At April’s White House Easter Egg Roll, Hunter appeared gaunt but composed, telling a guest, “One day at a time”—a mantra familiar to anyone in recovery.  Legal analysts are split on the case’s implications. While convictions for similar offenses often result in probation, Hunter faces up to 25 years if sentenced consecutively. “The judge has wide discretion,” said former U.S. attorney Harry Litman. “But juries don’t love addicts being punished for relapse.”  The bigger question may be the political fallout. Polls show most voters don’t blame presidents for their adult children’s troubles, but Trump’s campaign is betting otherwise. “This trial keeps Hunter’s scandals in the headlines through the summer,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant. Democrats counter that the spectacle could backfire. “After Trump’s conviction, Republicans look hypocritical suddenly demanding ‘law and order’ for Hunter,” said Democratic operative Lis Smith.  As testimony begins June 3, the Bidens will confront a ritual they’ve endured since Beau’s death in 2015: private pain under public glare. The president isn’t expected in court, but aides say he’ll be watching—and waiting—for the moment his son walks out, free or otherwise. However it ends, one thing is certain: For a family that’s survived unimaginable loss, this trial is another test of resilience. And for a nation fatigued by division, it’s one more stress test of how justice and politics collide.\n",

      "Статья до изменений: President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",
      "Оценка статьи: - **Tone & Emotional Framing**: The original maintains a measured, journalistic tone with subtle emotional undertones (e.g., \"a concern that nags at him as a father\"), while the generated version leans into dramatic phrasing (\"nothing cuts deeper,\" \"reopen old wounds\") and overt sentimentality (\"For a family that’s survived unimaginable loss\").  \n",
      "- **Narrative Structure**: The original focuses on Biden’s daily routine and familial bonds, grounding the story in routine and quiet moments (bike rides, church). The generated version prioritizes political conflict, framing the trial as part of a broader \"two-tiered justice system\" narrative with explicit partisan quotes.  \n",
      "- **Lexical Variety & Detail**: The original uses straightforward legal and political terminology (\"politically motivated,\" \"legal team\"). The generated version employs vivid metaphors (\"lightning rod,\" \"stress test\") and niche details (e.g., Colt Cobra revolver, \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\") for sensationalism.  \n",
      "- **Quotes & Attribution**: The original relies on vague sourcing (\"people who know him say,\" \"she recalled\"). The generated version cites specific figures (Jessica Levinson, Chris Coons, Steve Bannon) and fabricated dialogue (\"He’s the strongest person I know\") to bolster credibility while amplifying drama.  \n",
      "- **Pacing & Rhythm**: The original unfolds chronologically, with a steady cadence. The generated version jumps between legal analysis, political fallout, and personal history, creating a staccato effect designed to heighten tension.\n",
      "итоговая статья: President Joe Biden has faced countless challenges during his decades in public life, but few are as personally wrenching as watching his son prepare for a federal trial. On Monday, Hunter Biden will appear in a Wilmington courtroom to face charges of making false statements about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018. Legal observers note the case is unusual—prosecutions for such offenses are rare without accompanying violent crimes—yet it has taken on outsized political significance during an election year already marked by legal battles involving prominent figures.The president has maintained a steadfast public presence even as his son's legal troubles unfold. Those close to the family describe private moments where Biden checks in regularly, maintaining the quiet support that has characterized their relationship through Hunter's struggles with addiction. The two were recently seen riding bicycles near their Delaware home, a familiar routine for the president, who has long valued these small pockets of normalcy amid the demands of public office.Legal experts point out the complexities of the case. While the charges could technically carry severe penalties, similar cases often result in probation rather than prison time. Hunter Biden's legal team has argued the prosecution represents selective enforcement, a claim that has drawn attention given the broader political context. The timing of the trial, coming shortly after former President Donald Trump's recent conviction in New York, has fueled partisan arguments about fairness in the justice system.Republicans have seized on the case to renew allegations about the Biden family, while Democrats dismiss these attacks as politically motivated. The debate reflects the polarized climate in which the legal proceedings are unfolding, with both sides interpreting events through sharply different lenses. What remains less discussed is how the case fits into broader patterns of how the justice system handles addiction-related offenses—a policy question that often gets overshadowed by political theater.Hunter Biden has been open about his past substance abuse, documenting it in his memoir. His journey through recovery has been uneven, marked by both progress and setbacks. Those familiar with addiction treatment note that relapse is common, raising questions about whether the legal system is the most appropriate avenue for addressing such struggles. The case has prompted some to examine how drug addiction intersects with gun ownership laws—a policy area that remains contentious nationwide.As the trial begins, the focus will inevitably shift between the legal specifics and the broader political implications. For the president, it represents another chapter in a family story that has played out in public view for years—from personal losses to personal challenges. The proceedings will test not just legal arguments but also how the nation navigates the increasingly blurred lines between personal matters, political conflicts, and judicial processes. What remains clear is that for any family, regardless of position or prominence, such moments are never simple—they're layered with private emotions and public consequences that resist easy narratives.\n"

      "Оригинальные статья: The bill, which Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign this weekend, appeared to end the possibility that President Biden would not be on the state’s ballot in November. The Ohio General Assembly has passed a legislative fix that ensures President Biden will be on the state’s ballot in November, averting a crisis that had been brewing for weeks over what is typically a minor procedural issue. The secretary of state in Ohio, a Republican, had said that he planned to exclude Mr. Biden from the ballot because the president would not be officially nominated by his party until after a state deadline for certifying presidential nominees. That had threatened the possibility that the president would not be on the ballot in all 50 states. The General Assembly resolved the issue by passing a bill that pushes back the deadline to accommodate the date of the Democratic nominating convention. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill over the weekend, pending a legal review, according to a spokesman. The solution has been used before. Ohio passed temporary extensions to its certification deadline for President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 and for President Donald J. Trump in 2020. Other states that had similar deadline issues, including Alabama, have also passed legislative fixes with overwhelming bipartisan support, in 2024 and in other election cycles. But the solution proposed in the Ohio Legislature was entangled in a separate partisan clash over foreign donations. The General Assembly adjourned last week without a fix in place, after the Ohio Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, advanced a bill that would have resolved the issue but included a partisan measure banning foreign money in state ballot initiatives. Democrats opposed that measure, and the speaker of the Ohio House did not take it up before the chamber adjourned. Mr. DeWine then called a special legislative session to fix the problem, saying that legislators had failed “to take action on this urgent matter.” The General Assembly ultimately adopted two bills, one that fixed the ballot issue and another that banned donations in support of state ballot initiatives from foreign nationals, including immigrants with green cards. With the legislative solution appearing dead in the water last week, the Biden campaign considered suing the state to ensure that the president was on the ballot. Instead, the Democratic National Committee scheduled a virtual roll-call vote to officially nominate Mr. Biden ahead of the party’s convention in August. That vote is still set to go forward, even as the issue appears to be resolved. Hannah Muldavin, a spokeswoman for the committee, denounced what she called “partisan games” by Republican lawmakers that had delayed a solution. “Since the beginning of this process, Ohio Republicans have been playing partisan games and trying to chip away at our democracy, while Democrats have been defending Ohioans’ right to vote,” Ms. Muldavin said in a statement. Matt Huffman, the leader of the Ohio Senate, praised the foreign-influence ban, adding in a statement that Ohio “needed to ensure that President Biden is on the ballot in November, and it needed to be done legislatively.” Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.\n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: COLUMBUS, Ohio—With just weeks to spare, Ohio lawmakers raced to prevent an unprecedented scenario: a November ballot without President Joe Biden’s name. Late Thursday, the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed an emergency bill to push back the state’s certification deadline, clearing the way for Biden to appear on the ballot after the Democratic National Convention in August. Governor Mike DeWine, who called a rare special session to break a partisan deadlock, is expected to sign the measure into law by the weekend.  “This was about doing what’s right for Ohio voters,” DeWine told reporters after the vote. “No one should be disenfranchised because of a technicality.”  The crisis began in April when Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, flagged a glaring conflict: The Democratic Party’s official nomination of Biden, scheduled for August 19–22, would miss Ohio’s August 7 certification cutoff by nearly two weeks. Without intervention, Biden’s name wouldn’t make the ballot in a state that has decided the last two presidential elections by single-digit margins.  “This wasn’t just a paperwork problem—it was a ticking clock,” said Franklin County Elections Director Antone White, who fielded calls from anxious voters. “People were asking, ‘Does this mean I won’t get to vote for the president?’”  Ohio has been here before. In 2012, lawmakers granted temporary extensions for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney when their conventions ran late. Similar fixes were made in 2020 for Donald Trump. This year, Alabama, Washington, and Illinois also adjusted deadlines to accommodate both parties. But in Ohio, what should have been a straightforward update nearly collapsed under the weight of partisan brinkmanship.  Republicans initially tied the deadline extension to an unrelated ban on foreign donations to state ballot initiatives—a move Democrats called a “poison pill.” The standoff forced DeWine to summon lawmakers back to the Capitol on Tuesday, where he scolded them for “playing with fire.”  By Thursday, the legislature had split the measures, passing the ballot fix as a standalone bill while approving the foreign contribution ban separately. The latter, which bars donations from green card holders and foreign entities, drew swift condemnation from immigration advocates but was defended by Senate President Matt Huffman as a “common-sense shield against outside influence.”  Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign had been preparing for the worst—exploring lawsuits and an early virtual nomination vote by the DNC to circumvent Ohio’s deadline. Though the legislative fix has likely rendered those plans unnecessary, the DNC confirmed it will proceed with a virtual roll call as a backup.  “This should never have been so difficult,” said Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson. “Republicans held Ohio voters hostage to pass an agenda they couldn’t get through on its own.”  The drama underscores how even mundane election procedures have become flashpoints in a hyper-polarized era. “Election administration used to be boring,” said Dr. Lisa Bryant, a Kent State political scientist. “Now, every deadline, every rule is a potential weapon. That’s dangerous for democracy.”  With the deadline extended, Ohio dodges a legal and logistical nightmare—but the broader fight over election rules is far from over. For voters like retired teacher Marcia Dunlap of Cincinnati, the resolution came as a relief. “It shouldn’t take a circus just to make sure our votes count,” she said. “But at least now, when I cast my ballot, I’ll know it’s complete.”  The fix ensures Ohio remains a full participant in what could be another razor-thin presidential race. And for election officials, it’s one less wildfire to put out in a year already brimming with them.  *Chris Cameron contributed reporting.*\n",

      "Доработанная статья: COLUMBUS, Ohio—Ohio lawmakers approved emergency legislation late Thursday to adjust the state's ballot certification deadline, resolving a potential conflict that could have left President Joe Biden off the November ballot. The Republican-controlled General Assembly passed the measure during a special session called by Governor Mike DeWine, who is expected to sign the bill promptly. The issue arose when Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, noted that the Democratic National Convention's August 19–22 nomination schedule would occur after Ohio's August 7 certification deadline. Without legislative action, Biden's name would not appear on ballots in a state that has played a pivotal role in recent presidential elections. \"We have a responsibility to ensure all voters can participate fully in the democratic process,\" DeWine stated following the vote. The governor had urged lawmakers to address the matter without delay, emphasizing the need to avoid disenfranchising Ohio voters over a procedural discrepancy. This marks the third consecutive presidential election cycle in which Ohio has adjusted its certification timeline to accommodate party conventions. Similar temporary extensions were granted in 2012 for both major party nominees and in 2020. Several other states, including Alabama and Illinois, have made comparable adjustments this year. The legislative process encountered complications when Republican leaders initially linked the deadline extension to unrelated provisions concerning foreign donations to ballot initiatives. After days of negotiations, lawmakers ultimately separated the issues, passing the ballot access measure as standalone legislation while considering the campaign finance restrictions separately. Senate President Matt Huffman defended the foreign contribution ban, stating it would prevent undue influence in state elections. The provision has drawn criticism from advocacy groups who argue it could disproportionately affect certain communities. The Biden campaign had been preparing contingency plans, including potential legal challenges and an early virtual nomination process, though these measures now appear unnecessary. Democratic National Committee officials expressed relief at the resolution while criticizing what they characterized as unnecessary delays. Election administrators across Ohio welcomed the clarity provided by the legislative action. \"Our priority is ensuring smooth operations and voter confidence,\" said one county elections official, who noted that the adjusted timeline allows sufficient preparation for November. The episode highlights ongoing tensions surrounding election administration in a politically divided climate. While the immediate issue has been resolved, broader debates about voting procedures and ballot access continue nationwide. Ohio's solution ensures the state will participate fully in what analysts predict could be another closely contested presidential election. The legislation takes effect immediately upon the governor's signature, providing election officials with the necessary timeframe to prepare ballots containing all certified candidates. State leaders from both parties acknowledged the importance of maintaining public trust in the electoral process while adhering to statutory requirements. With the certification deadline extended, attention now turns to the general election campaign in a state that has frequently served as a bellwether in presidential politics. The resolution avoids potential confusion that could have arisen from incomplete ballots while preserving Ohio's role in the national electoral process. This marks the latest in a series of adjustments to election administration procedures across multiple states as officials balance statutory deadlines with the practical realities of modern political conventions. The outcome reflects a bipartisan recognition of the need to accommodate established nomination processes while maintaining election integrity.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty, he and a number of conservative figures in the news media and lawmakers on the right have spread false and misleading claims about the Manhattan case. After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, he instantly rejected the verdict and assailed the judge and criminal justice system. His loyalists in the conservative news media and Congress quickly followed suit, echoing his baseless assertions that he had fallen victim to a politically motivated sham trial. The display of unity reflected the extent of Mr. Trump’s hold over his base. The former president and his supporters have singled out the judge who presided over the case, denigrated the judicial system and distorted the circumstances of the charges against him and his subsequent conviction. Here’s a fact check of some of their claims. What Was Said “We had a conflicted judge, highly conflicted. There’s never been a more conflicted judge.”— Mr. Trump in a news conference on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan This is exaggerated. For over a year, Mr. Trump and his allies have said Justice Juan M. Merchan should not preside over the case because of his daughter’s line of work. Loren Merchan, the daughter, served as the president of a digital campaign strategy agency that has done work for many prominent Democrats, including Mr. Biden’s 2020 campaign. Experts in judicial ethics have said Ms. Merchan’s work is not sufficient grounds for recusal. When Mr. Trump’s legal team sought his recusal because of his daughter, Justice Merchan sought counsel from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which said it did not see any conflict of interest. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: The Manhattan courtroom fell silent as the jury foreperson stood to deliver the verdict—34 guilty counts ringing out one after another in rapid succession. For the first time in U.S. history, a former president had been convicted of felony crimes. But before the ink could dry on the court documents, Donald Trump's supporters launched a full-throated assault on the justice system itself.  \"Total witch hunt!\" Trump declared to cameras outside the courthouse, his face flushed with anger as supporters chanted in the background. Within hours, the misinformation machine roared to life. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed without evidence that Judge Juan Merchan had \"coached\" the jury, while Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that the prosecution was \"Soros-funded lawfare\"—a false assertion repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers.  Legal experts swiftly countered the attacks. \"Judges don’t step aside just because a defendant happens to be a politician,\" said Columbia Law professor Jessica Roth, who reviewed the case. \"If that were the standard, no high-profile defendant would ever face trial.\" The backlash focused on Merchan’s daughter working at a progressive digital firm, but ethics panels—including a bipartisan New York judicial committee—had already vetted and approved his impartiality.  \"Let’s be clear: Trump’s team had every chance to challenge this judge earlier,\" former federal prosecutor Harry Litman told reporters. \"They didn’t object during jury selection. Only after losing did they suddenly cry foul.\"  The misinformation didn’t stop there. Trump allies insisted the case was unprecedented—ignoring that Manhattan prosecutors have brought over 30 business falsification cases in recent years. One such case involved a restaurant owner who doctored records to hide cash payments from employees. Another targeted a real estate developer who, like Trump, allegedly inflated asset values to secure loans. The key difference? Prosecutors tied Trump’s actions to election interference, elevating misdemeanors to felonies—a controversial but legally permissible move.  As the July 11 sentencing date looms, the political fallout intensifies. At a rally in Arizona, Trump supporter Linda Michaels, 62, called the verdict \"an attack on all of us.\" Meanwhile, GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson vow to retaliate, promising congressional investigations into the prosecutors.  Legal analysts note that while Trump faces up to four years per count, first-time offenders in similar cases typically receive probation. But the real battle isn’t just in the courts—it’s in the court of public opinion, where facts and falsehoods now wage an all-out war.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes when a Manhattan jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records. The historic verdict, delivered after a six-week trial, immediately sparked a wave of criticism from Trump and his allies, who denounced the proceedings as politically motivated.  Speaking outside the courthouse, Trump repeated his claim that the case represented a \"witch hunt\" orchestrated by Democratic prosecutors. His legal team and supporters quickly turned their focus on Judge Juan Merchan, alleging bias due to his daughter’s employment at a progressive political consulting firm. However, judicial ethics committees had previously reviewed and cleared Merchan’s involvement in the case.  Legal experts pushed back against claims of judicial misconduct. \"Recusal standards don’t change based on a defendant’s public profile,\" said Jessica Roth, a professor at Columbia Law School. \"The defense had ample opportunity to raise objections during jury selection but chose not to do so until after the verdict.\"  The case centered on allegations that Trump falsified business records to conceal hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors argued that these actions amounted to election interference, elevating what would typically be misdemeanor charges to felonies. While Trump’s allies framed the prosecution as unprecedented, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office has pursued similar cases against other business figures, including a real estate developer accused of inflating asset values for financial gain.  Republican leaders swiftly condemned the verdict, with House Speaker Mike Johnson pledging congressional investigations into the prosecution. Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has sought to leverage the conviction for political gain, framing it as evidence of a weaponized justice system.  Legal analysts note that while Trump could face up to four years in prison per count, first-time offenders in comparable cases often receive probation or shorter sentences. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention.  The case has further intensified the polarized political climate, with Trump’s supporters rallying behind him while critics argue the verdict reinforces accountability. As appeals and political fallout unfold, the legal and electoral implications of the conviction remain uncertain.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Taylor Swift was not at the White House to celebrate with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, but kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew controversy for a commencement speech, attended. Reporting from the White House On Friday, President Biden urgently called for an end to the war in Gaza. He solemnly discussed the rule of law after former President Donald J. Trump’s criminal conviction. And he donned a shiny red helmet to the whoops and cheers of a pack of football players and fans. The visit to the White House by the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their second straight Super Bowl win gave the president a few moments of frivolity in a week replete with sobering events. “Winning back-to-back — I kind of like that,” Mr. Biden said, hinting at the tough re-election bid he faces in his rematch with Mr. Trump. He added, “When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.” The South Lawn celebration was a blip on the president’s schedule, squeezed between a meeting with the prime minister of Belgium and his weekend plans in Rehoboth Beach, Del., during a month with an endless string of campaign events. Yet, with some of the National Football League’s most famous names, it carried a certain celebrity wattage. Still, the spotlight was far dimmer than it could have been. Taylor Swift did not make the trip with her boyfriend, the star tight end Travis Kelce, as she was touring in Europe and had performed in Madrid on Thursday night. The White House had previously said it was up to the Chiefs whether to extend an invitation to the star musician, who has largely avoided embroiling herself in politics. She endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020, leading to speculation about whether she would do so again. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: The roar of \"Chiefs Kingdom\" chants echoed across the White House South Lawn Friday as President Biden fumbled with a red helmet before finally securing it on his head—drawing cheers from players and laughter from quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \"Don't worry, Mr. President,\" Mahomes shouted over the crowd, \"took me three seasons to figure out how to wear mine right too!\"  Under a blazing June sun, about 2,000 fans and staff watched Biden welcome the back-to-back Super Bowl champions in what became part victory lap, part campaign stop. The president leaned into football metaphors throughout his 12-minute speech, drawing clear parallels between the Chiefs' underdog story and his own political fight. \"When people wrote you off after that rough September start?\" Biden said, pointing to Mahomes. \"Sound familiar? I know a little something about being counted out.\"  The event's lighthearted atmosphere—complete with Biden joking about wanting Travis Kelce's biceps—couldn't completely mask its political undertones. Political strategists noted the careful choreography: the championship trophy placed just so behind the presidential podium, the navy blue backdrop dotted with red and gold Chiefs logos. \"Every frame matters in an election year,\" said veteran Democratic operative Maria Cardona, watching from the press pen. \"This wasn't just a photo op—it was a values contrast with Trump's divisive rallies.\"  One conspicuous absence drew more attention than any attendee: Taylor Swift, currently mid-European tour, left a noticeable gap in the team's star power. White House staffers confirmed to NBC News they'd deferred to the Chiefs on guest invitations, though Kelce later told reporters, \"She's got her own kingdom to rule right now\" when asked about Swift's missing presence. The pop star's absence fueled fresh speculation about whether she'll repeat her 2020 Biden endorsement, with Gen Z voters particularly attuned to her potential influence.  The event took an unexpected turn when kicker Harrison Butker—fresh off controversy for his traditionalist commencement speech—received a mix of boos and cheers during introductions. Nearby, two fans wearing \"Butker 2028\" shirts clashed verbally with a group of women in Mahomes jerseys who turned their backs during his appearance. \"We're here for football, not sermons,\" said Kansas City teacher Lisa Yang, 34, who traveled for the event.  Political communication expert Dr. Emily Carter of Georgetown observed the tightrope walk in real time: \"Biden needs sports' unifying appeal, but these cultural flashpoints—Swift's absence, Butker's presence—show how today's athletes carry more baggage than just shoulder pads.\" As Marine One's blades began whirring overhead, signaling Biden's next engagement, Kelce could be heard joking with staffers: \"Guess we're not getting that White House sleepover after all.\" The remark—equal parts playful and revealing—captured the day's delicate dance between celebration and calculation.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: President Joe Biden welcomed the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House on Friday, marking the team’s second consecutive Super Bowl victory with a ceremony that blended celebration and political messaging. The event, held on the South Lawn under clear skies, drew roughly 2,000 attendees, including players, staff, and fans, as Biden praised the team’s resilience and drew implicit parallels to his own reelection campaign.  Standing beside the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Biden referenced the Chiefs’ early-season struggles before their championship run. \"When people wrote you off after that tough start, you proved them wrong,\" he said, addressing quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \"I know a little something about being counted out.\" The remark, delivered with a smile, underscored the political subtext of an otherwise routine sports celebration. Observers noted the careful staging—team logos flanking the presidential podium, the trophy positioned prominently—a visual contrast to the more combative tone of his opponent’s campaign events.  The absence of Taylor Swift, who is currently on tour overseas, became an unspoken talking point. While the pop star’s relationship with tight end Travis Kelce has brought unprecedented attention to the team, her nonattendance left questions about whether she would weigh in on the 2024 race as she did four years ago. Kelce deflected when asked about her, telling reporters, \"She’s got her own commitments.\" The moment highlighted the intersection of sports, celebrity, and politics, particularly among younger voters attuned to Swift’s influence.  Controversy briefly surfaced when kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew criticism for a polarizing commencement speech, received mixed reactions from the crowd. A handful of boos were audible during introductions, though the event otherwise proceeded without disruption. The tension, however fleeting, reflected broader cultural divisions that have increasingly seeped into sports.  Political analysts viewed the gathering as a strategic effort by the Biden administration to align with the unifying appeal of athletics while navigating the complexities of modern fandom. \"These events are never just about sports anymore,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a professor of political communication at Georgetown University. \"Every detail—who’s present, who’s absent, how the team is framed—carries weight in an election year.\"  As the ceremony concluded and players dispersed, the balancing act between commemoration and campaigning remained evident. The Chiefs’ visit, like so many before it, served as both a recognition of athletic achievement and a reflection of the political moment—a reminder that even the most celebratory occasions are rarely free from broader implications.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Salem Media Group, which co-produced the 2022 film, issued the apology to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as stuffing a ballot box near Atlanta. The conservative media company Salem Media Group has apologized to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as having committed election fraud in the film “2,000 Mules,” which Salem co-produced and released in 2022. The documentary, written and directed by the right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, claimed that Democrats had conspired with nonprofit groups to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden by using “mules” who stuffed ballot boxes in swing states. More than a million people watched “2,000 Mules” in just the first two weeks after its release in May 2022, and the film grossed over $10 million. Its unfounded allegations became an article of faith for an untold number of Americans convinced that the election had been stolen. Five months later, Salem released a companion book. The film features surveillance video of the man from Georgia, Mark Andrews, as he places ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D’Souza calling the action “a crime” and adding, “These are fraudulent votes.” Although Mr. Andrews’s face is blurred in the images, the film’s producers used unblurred versions of the same video to promote the film on a variety of conservative news outlets, including Tucker Carlson’s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem. Mr. Andrews sued Mr. D’Souza, along with Salem and two individuals associated with the right-wing election-monitoring group True the Vote, for defamation in October 2022. State investigators in Georgia have since found that Mr. Andrews committed no crime and that he had legally deposited the ballots for himself and several members of his family. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Mark Andrews was at home scrolling through social media when he first saw himself onscreen—his face blurred but unmistakable—being accused of election fraud in *2,000 Mules*, the incendiary 2022 documentary that became a lightning rod for conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. \"I felt sick,\" Andrews told *The Chronicle*, recalling the moment. \"They turned me into a villain for doing something completely legal. Suddenly, strangers online were calling me a criminal, threatening my family. It was terrifying.\"  The film, co-produced by Salem Media Group and directed by right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, alleged that so-called \"mules\" working for Democratic operatives illegally stuffed ballot boxes in swing states. Andrews, a Georgia resident, was shown in surveillance footage depositing multiple ballots into a drop box near Atlanta—a routine act that D’Souza’s narration framed as \"a crime\" and \"fraudulent votes.\" But state investigators quickly debunked the claim, confirming Andrews had legally submitted ballots for himself and relatives.  The backlash was immediate. Andrews’ social media accounts flooded with vitriol, including death threats and messages like \"Hope you rot in prison.\" One user posted his home address online, forcing him to contact law enforcement. \"I had to explain to my kids why people were saying these things about me,\" Andrews said, his voice shaking. \"No one should have to go through that.\"  Salem Media Group, known for amplifying controversial conservative content—from pandemic misinformation to election fraud claims—apologized publicly this week after Andrews filed a defamation lawsuit in October 2022. Legal experts say the case could test the limits of accountability for partisan media. \"When documentaries weaponize cherry-picked footage, real people pay the price,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a media ethics professor at the University of Georgia.  D’Souza and Salem have defended the film as \"political speech,\" with Salem’s lawyers arguing it was protected commentary. Yet the damage persists: *2,000 Mules*, which grossed over $10 million and drew more than a million viewers in its first two weeks, continues to fuel election skepticism. Lawmakers in several states have cited the debunked film to justify restrictive voting laws, while grassroots groups use it to rally supporters.  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who repeatedly certified the state’s 2020 results, condemned the film’s portrayal of Andrews. \"Baseless accusations erode trust in democracy,\" he said. \"Media outlets have a duty to vet claims before spreading them.\"  As Andrews’ lawsuit moves forward, his case underscores a darker trend: how misinformation, once unleashed, can upend lives and linger long after the facts prevail. \"This isn’t just about me,\" Andrews said. \"It’s about stopping the next person from being targeted.\"\n",

The 2022 film, co-produced by Salem Media Group and directed by conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, used surveillance footage to claim individuals illegally deposited multiple ballots in swing states during the 2020 election.

Georgia election officials confirmed Andrews had legally delivered ballots for himself and family members, a common practice permitted under state law at the time. Despite these clarifications, Andrews reported receiving hostile messages online after the film's release.  Salem Media Group issued a public apology this week as the lawsuit progresses. Legal analysts suggest the case could raise questions about accountability in partisan media, particularly when documentary films present disputed claims as factual. The production company has defended the project as protected political speech, while critics argue it misrepresented routine voting activities as evidence of fraud.  The film, which generated significant revenue and viewership, continues to influence political discourse. Some state legislators have referenced its debunked claims when advocating for stricter voting regulations. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who upheld the state's 2020 election results, criticized the documentary's portrayal of Andrews, emphasizing the importance of factual accuracy in election-related media.  Andrews' lawsuit highlights ongoing concerns about the lasting consequences of misinformation, even after official corrections are issued. The case also reflects broader debates about media responsibility and the real-world impact of disputed narratives on private citizens caught in political controversies. Legal proceedings are expected to examine whether the film's producers exercised sufficient diligence in verifying claims before presenting them to audiences.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Interviews with dozens of Democrats reveal a party hungry to tell voters that Donald Trump’s conviction makes him unfit for office, and hopeful that President Biden will lead the way. By Reid J. Epstein and Nicholas Nehamas Now that former President Donald J. Trump is a convicted criminal, the Democratic Party finds itself wrestling with a choice that will help define this year’s presidential race: Should it try to push his felonies to the center of the election? The route Democrats take may determine not only Mr. Biden’s fortunes but also, they say, the future of American democracy. Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernatural ability to survive even this political peril. Post-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — including current and former members of Congress, statewide elected officials, veteran strategists, Democratic National Committee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s conviction makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press that argument. “I do think it is the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is now a convicted felon and just how unprecedented this is,” said former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination against Mr. Biden in 2020. Even as Democrats broadly push Mr. Biden to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s felonies, there is a spectrum of opinion on just how much to focus on them.  Mr. Biden himself has deployed a two-pronged strategy, speaking carefully about Mr. Trump’s legal problems even as his campaign grows more aggressive: On Friday evening, it fired off an evening statement that referred, for the first time, to “Convicted Felon Donald Trump.” \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: The moment the guilty verdict was read in a Manhattan courtroom last week, the Democratic war room sprang into action. Within hours, the Biden campaign blasted fundraising emails with the subject line: \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\" By morning, digital ads featuring the words \"Guilty on All Counts\" in bold red type flooded battleground state social media feeds.  \"It’s not every day your opponent gets convicted of 34 felonies,\" said Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who’s helping coordinate rapid-response efforts. \"We’re going to make sure voters never forget it—from now until November.\"  Interviews with dozens of Democratic officials, strategists, and voters reveal a party energized by Trump’s unprecedented legal downfall but wrestling with how hard to press their advantage. While some see the conviction as a silver bullet, others warn against overplaying their hand in what remains a volatile political climate.  \"Look, I’ll say it plainly—a felon shouldn’t be president,\" declared former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland at a union hall rally in Cleveland, drawing cheers. But moments later, he cautioned: \"We can’t just run on ‘Lock him up’ chants. People care about their paychecks and prescription costs too.\"  The Biden campaign’s approach reflects this tension. Though the president himself has avoided gloating—his only public comment being a restrained \"the American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed\"—his team has gone on offense. New battleground state ads contrast Biden’s infrastructure projects with footage of the verdict announcement, while debate prep teams are reportedly crafting zingers branding Trump as \"the convicted candidate.\"  Republican operatives are already countering. \"This is banana republic stuff,\" Trump adviser Jason Miller told Fox News, claiming the conviction has triggered a flood of small-dollar donations. At a MAGA rally in Phoenix, the crowd broke into chants of \"Trump 2024!\" as the former president vowed to appeal, calling the case \"election interference.\"  Recent polling suggests the verdict may move the needle. A CNN survey found 50% of registered voters approve of the conviction, including 16% of Republicans. But strategists note the real test will come in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where focus groups show suburban women expressing fresh doubts about Trump.  \"These voters weren’t going to Trump anyway, but the conviction makes them less likely to stay home,\" said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. \"The danger for Republicans is it becomes cumulative—the verdict plus January 6 plus the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape creates a ‘too much baggage’ perception.\"  With sentencing set for July 11—just days before the GOP convention—the legal drama is far from over. Democratic attorneys general in several states are exploring whether the conviction affects ballot access, while Republican legislatures rush to pass resolutions condemning the trial.  At a Detroit diner, nurse practitioner Claire Williamson summed up the split-screen moment: \"I’ve never seen anything like this—a former president with a rap sheet while running again. It feels like we’re living in a history book, and not a good chapter.\"  As both campaigns recalibrate, one thing is clear: The 2024 election just entered uncharted territory.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: The guilty verdict in Donald Trump's hush money trial last week sent immediate ripples through the political landscape, presenting Democrats with both opportunity and risk as they navigate how to respond. While the Biden campaign wasted no time incorporating the conviction into its messaging, party leaders appear divided on how prominently to feature the unprecedented development in their electoral strategy.Within 24 hours of the verdict, the Biden campaign had launched targeted digital ads highlighting Trump's legal troubles alongside the president's policy achievements. Yet interviews with more than two dozen Democratic strategists, elected officials, and voters reveal careful deliberation about how to balance condemnation of Trump's actions with focus on kitchen-table issues. \"This conviction confirms what we've known about Donald Trump's character,\" said Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. \"But voters ultimately care more about who will lower their costs and protect their rights.\"The party's cautious approach reflects internal polling showing mixed reactions to the verdict's electoral impact. While some Democratic candidates in swing districts have begun incorporating the conviction into their stump speeches, others worry about overemphasis. \"We can't make this election just about Trump's legal problems,\" said Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow. \"People want to hear solutions on healthcare and jobs—that's what wins races.\"Republican leaders have largely closed ranks around Trump, framing the conviction as politically motivated. \"This isn't justice—it's a sham trial designed to interfere with an election,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson during a press conference. The unified response comes as GOP fundraising platforms report surges in donations following the verdict, suggesting the case may have energized Trump's base.Political analysts note the verdict's impact may be most pronounced among key voter blocs. \"Suburban women and independent voters who were already skeptical of Trump now have concrete reasons to oppose him,\" said Sarah Longwell of the Republican Accountability Project. \"But the real question is whether this becomes a defining issue or gets overshadowed by economic concerns.\"The Biden campaign has taken measured steps to capitalize on the moment without appearing overly celebratory. The president's restrained statement emphasizing \"the rule of law\" contrasted with more aggressive messaging from allied groups. Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, began testing ads pairing footage of the verdict with Trump's past controversial statements.Legal experts caution that the political fallout remains unpredictable, especially with sentencing scheduled for July and potential appeals pending. Some state election officials have begun reviewing whether the conviction affects ballot access procedures, while constitutional scholars debate whether a potential prison sentence would complicate a presidential campaign.At a union hall in Pittsburgh, steelworker Mark Reynolds expressed the ambivalence many voters feel. \"Sure, it matters that he's a convicted felon,\" Reynolds said. \"But what matters more is whether my paycheck keeps up with prices at the grocery store.\" This sentiment underscores the challenge for both parties as they attempt to frame a historic legal development within an election increasingly focused on economic anxieties.As the campaigns adjust their strategies, the verdict has undeniably added another layer of complexity to an already unprecedented election cycle. With five months until Election Day, both sides recognize that how voters process this development may prove as important as the verdict itself.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Five months after filing for bankruptcy, the former New York City mayor disclosed his company’s income from a foundation established to honor a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. By David A. Fahrenthold and Eileen Sullivan Because of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been indicted in two states and hit with a $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek bankruptcy protection. Through all of that, he has kept a reliable financial ally: a charity founded to honor the memory of a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. The problem, according to his creditors’ lawyers, is that he has withheld that detail throughout his first five months of bankruptcy proceedings. In a filing last week, attorneys for Mr. Giuliani said that one of the former New York City mayor’s companies, Giuliani Communications, receives about $16,300 per month in income from his internet show “America’s Mayor Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s attorney said that money comes “mainly” from the Sept. 11 charity, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The revelation of the revenue stream comes after months of deeply contentious arguments from creditors about the state of Mr. Giuliani’s personal finances, with complaints that much of it remains deliberately incomplete and opaque. Only recently did creditors learn, through social media, that Mr. Giuliani had a contract to earn money from a new branded coffee line. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation confirmed that it sponsored both the livestream and Mr. Giuliani’s now-canceled radio show. The group declined to say how much it paid overall. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Once hailed as \"America’s Mayor\" for his leadership after 9/11, Rudolph Giuliani now finds himself in a starkly different chapter—battling bankruptcy, a $148 million defamation judgment, and accusations of financial opacity. The latest twist? A nonprofit honoring a fallen 9/11 firefighter has been quietly bankrolling his media ventures.  Court documents reveal that Giuliani’s struggling livestream show, *America’s Mayor Live*—a mix of election conspiracy theories and interviews with fringe figures—relies heavily on the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which covers roughly $16,300 of its monthly $17,000 revenue. The charity, named for a firefighter who died rushing into the Twin Towers, confirmed it sponsored both the show and a short-lived radio program. \"We supported content highlighting first responders and veterans,\" said foundation CEO Frank Siller, Stephen’s brother, though he declined to specify total payments.  The sponsorship, undisclosed in Giuliani’s bankruptcy filings until now, has ignited fury among creditors. \"This isn’t just oversight—it’s a pattern,\" argued a lawyer for the Georgia election workers who won the massive defamation verdict against Giuliani for falsely accusing them of ballot fraud. Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the mother-daughter duo targeted by his claims, saw their lives upended by threats; their legal team now questions whether charitable funds helped bankroll Giuliani’s legal defenses.  Bankruptcy experts say the omission could carry consequences. \"Courts demand total transparency—especially when a debtor’s income comes from a 9/11 charity,\" said UNC law professor Melissa Jacoby. Giuliani’s attorneys counter that all income streams were properly reported, blaming delays on \"logistical hurdles.\"  But creditors smell smoke. They recently discovered—via Giuliani’s Instagram, not court papers—that he’d struck a deal with *Rudy.Coffee*, a conservative-branded coffee line hawking \"Fighting for Justice\" blends. The venture’s revenue remains murky, much like the $200,000 in \"consulting fees\" Giuliani allegedly pocketed from a mystery client last year.  For Tunnel to Towers, the arrangement risks reputational fallout. The foundation, which builds smart homes for disabled veterans, now faces awkward questions about subsidizing a figure entangled in election lies. \"Donors trust us to honor heroes, not fund political operatives,\" one longtime supporter grumbled anonymously.  As Giuliani’s assets dwindle—his Manhattan condo recently listed for $6.5 million—the bankruptcy battle grows fiercer. With creditors demanding forensic accounting and legal fees mounting, the man who once stood atop Ground Zero’s rubble finds himself buried in liabilities, his financial maze still revealing new turns.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor once celebrated for his response to the 9/11 attacks, is now facing significant financial and legal challenges, including a $148 million defamation judgment and bankruptcy proceedings. Recent court filings have revealed that a nonprofit organization dedicated to honoring a fallen 9/11 firefighter has been financially supporting Giuliani’s media projects.  According to bankruptcy documents, Giuliani’s livestream program, *America’s Mayor Live*, which frequently features discussions on election-related conspiracy theories, receives nearly all of its monthly revenue—approximately $16,300 out of $17,000—from the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The charity, named after a firefighter who died responding to the World Trade Center attacks, confirmed it had sponsored the show as well as a now-defunct radio program. Frank Siller, the foundation’s CEO and brother of the late firefighter, stated that the support was intended for content highlighting first responders and veterans but did not disclose the total amount paid.  The sponsorship arrangement, which was not initially disclosed in Giuliani’s bankruptcy filings, has drawn scrutiny from creditors, including legal representatives for two Georgia election workers who successfully sued Giuliani for defamation. The workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, were falsely accused of election fraud by Giuliani, leading to a barrage of threats against them. Their legal team has raised concerns about whether charitable funds may have been used to support Giuliani’s legal expenses.  Legal experts note that failure to fully disclose income sources in bankruptcy proceedings can have serious consequences. Melissa Jacoby, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, emphasized that courts require complete financial transparency, particularly when funds originate from a nonprofit organization. Giuliani’s attorneys maintain that all income was properly reported, attributing any delays to administrative challenges.  Further complicating matters, creditors recently uncovered through Giuliani’s social media that he had entered into a business agreement with *Rudy.Coffee*, a conservative-themed coffee brand. The financial details of this venture remain unclear, as do the origins of $200,000 in consulting fees Giuliani reportedly received last year from an undisclosed client.  The revelation of the foundation’s financial support has raised questions about potential reputational risks for the charity, which primarily focuses on providing homes for disabled veterans. Some donors have expressed unease about the organization’s ties to Giuliani, whose political activities have been a source of controversy.  As Giuliani’s financial situation continues to deteriorate—his Manhattan apartment was recently listed for sale at $6.5 million—creditors are pushing for a thorough review of his finances. With mounting legal fees and increasing demands for accountability, the former mayor’s bankruptcy case remains unresolved, revealing new complexities as it unfolds.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: For the remaining undecided voters, the decision to pick former President Donald J. Trump could be more difficult now that he is a felon. By Jonathan WeismanKellen Browning and Maya King Jonathan Weisman reported from Bristol and Racine, Wis. Kellen Browning reported from Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz. Maya King reported from Philadelphia and Ardmore, Pa. As the nation’s electorate processed the felony convictions of Donald J. Trump, the partisan divide in the verdict’s wake did not look so much like opposing sides of a chasm but like two alternate universes, one where the former president had been hounded and persecuted by his corrupt political enemies, the other where justice had finally been served to a career criminal. Where the two sides were even within shouting distance of each other was vanishingly small, if it existed at all. But a few voices in the Trump universe allowed that Mr. Trump may well have done something wrong, and a few in the anti-Trump sphere said they had finally been convinced to vote for his opponent, President Biden. Dozens of interviews with voters in the swing states of Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as Iowa, found not a single supporter of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who had been pulled from his side by his conviction on 34 felony counts of fabricating business records to hide hush-money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election. Prosecutors had framed their case in the loftiest of terms, election interference — an all-out effort to thwart the exposure of a sex scandal that may well have changed the course of history. That was not how Mr. Trump’s supporters saw it. “I think that this was all a setup and rigged just like the election,” said Marty Lee, 77, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who was wearing a T-shirt that read “We the People Are Pissed Off.” The trial was “a kangaroo court,” he added. (False claims that the 2020 election was rigged, pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies, have been repeatedly debunked, and there is no basis for the suggestion that the Manhattan case or the verdict rendered unanimously by a jury of 12 was rigged.) Even Democrats were skeptical that the convictions would make a difference. “I’m cynical,” said Paula Doty, a 53-year-old teacher from Powers Lake, Wis., who applauded the verdict, “because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” “I’m cynical because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” Paula Doty, 53, Powers Lake, Wis. \n",

Like many Trump supporters interviewed, Lee dismissed the unanimous jury verdict as election interference—a claim legal experts from both parties have repeatedly debunked. \"They've been trying to take him down since 2016,\" Lee added, jabbing his finger at a Fox News broadcast playing above the bar.But in a Powers Lake, Wisconsin classroom, 53-year-old teacher Paula Doty paused while grading papers to process the news. \"It's about damn time someone held him accountable,\" she told me, though her relief was tempered by pragmatism. She leaned forward, lowering her voice as if sharing a state secret: \"But let's be real—his people won't care. They'll just dig in deeper.\"The emotional whiplash reflects America's polarized reality. According to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 67% of Democrats say the conviction makes them less likely to support Trump, while 64% of Republicans say it makes no difference to their vote. But it's the narrow slice of undecided voters—about 7% of the electorate, per Pew Research—that could tip the scales in battleground states.\"For voters who were genuinely torn, this introduces a new calculus,\" explained Dr. Evelyn Carter, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who studies voter behavior. She noted that key evidence—like Trump's own handwritten notes about reimbursements to Michael Cohen—could resonate differently with various demographics. \"College-educated suburban women might see this as disqualifying, while working-class voters may view it through an economic lens.\"Legal scholars point to damning testimony from former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and the paper trail of doctored invoices as particularly compelling evidence. \"This wasn't a he-said-she-said case,\" noted NYU law professor Rachel Barkow. \"The smoking guns were in the documents.\"Yet in Phoenix, small business owner Daniel Ruiz embodied the conflicted middle. The 42-year-old independent voter paced outside his auto repair shop, wiping grease from his hands as he wrestled with the news. \"I wasn't excited about Biden,\" he admitted, \"but a convicted felon? That's... something.\" His voice trailed off as a customer's truck rumbled into the bay.The conviction's electoral impact remains uncertain, but its legal ripple effects are already unfolding. Trump faces three more criminal cases—including federal charges over classified documents and January 6-related allegations—though delays may push those trials past Election Day. Meanwhile, both campaigns are retooling their messaging, with Trump fundraising off his \"persecution\" narrative and Democrats testing ads highlighting the verdict.As the dust settles, one thing seems clear: In a nation where politics has become tribal, even historic convictions may not change minds so much as harden positions. The real verdict will come not from twelve jurors in Manhattan, but from millions of voters this November—many of whom appear to have already rendered their judgment.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: The Manhattan courtroom had just delivered an unprecedented verdict—former President Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The decision marked the first criminal conviction of a former U.S. president, immediately reigniting the nation's political divisions.  Across the country, reactions split sharply along partisan lines. In Scottsdale, Arizona, retired mechanic Marty Lee sat at a diner counter, shaking his head as cable news played overhead. \"This was never about the law,\" he said, gesturing to his T-shirt emblazoned with Trump’s mugshot. \"They’ve been after him for years.\" His sentiment echoed widespread skepticism among Republican voters, many of whom dismissed the trial as politically motivated despite legal experts noting the jury’s unanimous decision.  Meanwhile, in Powers Lake, Wisconsin, high school teacher Paula Doty paused her grading to absorb the news. \"Accountability matters,\" she said, though she acknowledged the conviction might not sway staunch Trump supporters. \"For some, this changes nothing. For others, it’s a wake-up call.\"  Recent polling underscores the divide. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey found that two-thirds of Democrats viewed the conviction as disqualifying for Trump, while a similar majority of Republicans said it would not affect their vote. The real battleground, however, lies with the small but critical bloc of undecided voters—roughly 7% of the electorate, according to Pew Research—who could tip the scales in swing states.  \"Undecided voters now have a new factor to weigh,\" said Dr. Evelyn Carter, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"For some, a felony conviction may raise questions about fitness for office. For others, economic concerns or dissatisfaction with the current administration could still take precedence.\"  Legal analysts pointed to the prosecution’s reliance on documentary evidence—including Trump’s own financial records—as a key factor in securing the conviction. \"This wasn’t a case built on witness testimony alone,\" said NYU law professor Rachel Barkow. \"The paper trail was substantial.\"  Yet for independent voters like Daniel Ruiz, a Phoenix auto shop owner, the verdict introduced fresh uncertainty. \"I wasn’t thrilled about my options before,\" he admitted. \"Now it’s even messier.\"  The political fallout remains unpredictable. Trump faces three additional criminal cases, including federal charges related to classified documents and the January 6 Capitol riot, though delays could push those trials beyond Election Day. Both campaigns are already adjusting strategies, with Trump’s team framing the conviction as persecution while Democrats emphasize the rule of law.  As the election approaches, the verdict’s ultimate impact may hinge less on shifting entrenched opinions than on energizing turnout. In a deeply polarized electorate, the Manhattan jury’s decision is unlikely to change many minds—but it could sharpen the stakes for voters already bracing for a contentious rematch.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Campaign Notebook The indicted and increasingly isolated former New York mayor celebrated his birthday over pasta and meatballs. Donald J. Trump sent a video. Consider this Midtown split screen. Donald J. Trump on Friday appeared in the lobby of the gilded Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name to crow about the affection and campaign cash that have poured in since his conviction on 34 felonies. A few blocks away, at an Italian restaurant on East 56th Street, his former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was having a party for his 80th birthday. There was little to celebrate. Mr. Giuliani’s run-ins with the law have left his life and finances in tatters. As he left a previous party celebrating the same birthday, he was served notice of his indictment in an Arizona election-interference case. He has also been indicted in Georgia in connection to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Giuliani has filed for bankruptcy and owes two Georgia women a $148 million judgment from a defamation case. He is relying on a 9/11 charity as one of his last financial lifelines. Mr. Trump has done little to help with his legal bills. Earlier that very day, a board that oversees lawyer discipline in Washington recommended that Mr. Giuliani be disbarred. A little after 6 p.m., he stepped out of a Dodge Durango, helped along by a security detail, and into the restaurant, Amata, a white table-clothed, red-sauce joint owned by the brother-in-law of Anthony Carbonetti, the former mayor’s chief of staff at City Hall, who attended the party. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Rudy Giuliani’s 80th birthday party should have been a victory lap—a toast to the man once hailed as \"America’s Mayor.\" Instead, the dimly lit back room of Amata, an upscale Italian eatery in Midtown Manhattan, felt more like a wake. Between plates of handmade pappardelle and veal saltimbocca, the disgraced former mayor held court with a handful of loyalists, his security detail hovering nearby. Just blocks away, Donald Trump held court at Trump Tower, crowing about a post-conviction fundraising surge. The contrast couldn’t have been starker.  \"Happy birthday, Rudy!\" Trump’s prerecorded video message blared from a screen, offering cheer but no check—a hollow gesture for a man drowning in legal bills. Giuliani chuckled weakly, according to two attendees, but the weight of the day was inescapable. Hours earlier, a D.C. attorney disciplinary board had recommended his disbarment over his relentless promotion of 2020 election lies. It was just the latest blow: Arizona prosecutors indicted him last month for election interference, adding to his Georgia racketeering charges.  \"Rudy’s living scene-by-scene now,\" said a longtime associate, swirling a glass of Barolo. \"One minute he’s joking about the old days, the next he’s staring into space like he’s tallying up the damages.\" Those damages are staggering—$148 million owed to defamed Georgia election workers, bankruptcy filings, and a 9/11 charity controversially covering his bills. \"It’s tragic,\" the associate added. \"The guy who stood in the wreckage at Ground Zero can’t afford his own lawyers.\"  Yet some allies remain defiant. \"This is political persecution,\" insisted Ted Goodman, Giuliani’s spokesperson, as espresso cups clinked around him. \"They’re criminalizing dissent.\" Legal analysts aren’t convinced. \"The disciplinary board’s decision is a professional death sentence,\" said former federal prosecutor Mimi Rocah. \"But the real question is whether he’ll face prison time in Georgia or Arizona.\"  As the night wound down, Giuliani posed for photos beneath Amata’s vaulted brick arches—a venue chosen not for its Michelin stars, but because it’s owned by his ex-chief of staff’s brother-in-law. The cake arrived, candles flickering. For a moment, the room sang. Then the lights came up, the cameras turned off, and Giuliani shuffled out into the Manhattan night—alone with his mounting consequences.  The birthday boy’s wish? Probably the same one he’s had since 2020: a legal Hail Mary. But as the indictments pile up, even Rudy must know the clock’s running out.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: Rudy Giuliani celebrated his 80th birthday at Amata, an Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, with a small gathering of supporters. The subdued event stood in sharp contrast to the fanfare surrounding Donald Trump’s nearby appearance at Trump Tower, where the former president boasted about a surge in post-conviction donations. A prerecorded video message from Trump played during the dinner, offering birthday wishes but no financial support—a notable absence given Giuliani’s mounting legal troubles.  Earlier that day, a Washington, D.C., attorney disciplinary board recommended Giuliani’s disbarment for his role in spreading false claims about the 2020 election. The recommendation followed a series of legal setbacks, including indictments in Arizona and Georgia related to election interference. Giuliani, once celebrated as \"America’s Mayor,\" now faces financial strain, with a $148 million defamation judgment against him and reports that a 9/11 charity has helped cover his legal expenses.  Ted Goodman, Giuliani’s spokesperson, dismissed the disciplinary action as politically motivated. \"This is about silencing dissent, not upholding legal standards,\" Goodman said. Legal experts, however, see little chance of reversal. \"Disbarment is effectively the end of his legal career,\" said Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor. \"The bigger question is whether he’ll face prison time in the pending criminal cases.\"  The birthday dinner, held in a private room at Amata, was a modest affair. The restaurant’s connection to Giuliani—it’s owned by a relative of a former staffer—highlighted the shrinking circle of allies still willing to associate with him. Attendees described a somber atmosphere, with Giuliani alternating between reminiscing about his past and appearing distracted by his current legal woes.  As the event concluded, Giuliani posed for photos before leaving. The contrast between his diminished circumstances and Trump’s continued political prominence underscored the divergent paths of the two once-close allies. With multiple legal battles still unresolved, Giuliani’s future remains uncertain, his legacy increasingly defined by litigation rather than public service.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Law enforcement officers say they were pressured to lie when Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana killed a black wolf in 2021. He says the story is an election-year smear. Jonathan Weisman reported from Missoula, Whitefish and Kalispell, Mont. The game warden in Helena, Mont., received a phone call one morning in March 2021 with a request that he knew might not end well for him. His boss and friend at the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department asked him to record officially the killing of a wolf, a fairly routine request save for one detail. The hunter was the state’s governor, Greg Gianforte. “I said I wanted no part of it,” the warden, Justin Hawkaluk, recalled with a barely audible chuckle. Mr. Hawkaluk now says his sense of dread was warranted. By the time the wolf affair was settled, his superiors had pressured him to lie about the governor’s role, and his boss would be forced out of the department, he told The New York Times in his first interview about the episode. He, too, would leave a job he said he loved. The story of the governor, the wolf and the warden made few waves when it first broke. Wolf hunting is legal and fairly common in Montana. Mr. Gianforte was recorded as the killer of the animal, an adult black wolf, and given a warning for not having taken a required trapping course. A spokeswoman for the governor said Mr. Gianforte had “immediately rectified the mistake” by taking the course. A spokesman for the department said at the time that the matter had been handled as it would have been for anyone. But Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, is running for re-election this year, and some find the killing of a once-protected species distasteful. The treatment of wolves is back in the news, after a snowmobiler in Wyoming struck one, taped its mouth shut and showed it off at a bar before killing it. Law enforcement officers involved with recording Mr. Gianforte’s wolf, collared as No. 1155 by trackers in nearby Yellowstone National Park, now say the procedures were anything put typical. They say that officials leaned on them to record the governor’s hunting buddy, rather than governor himself, as the shooter, in an attempt to avoid giving the governor a citation, and that the officials bristled when the warden and his boss refused. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Beneath the snow-dusted ridges just north of Yellowstone National Park, a collared black wolf—known to researchers as No. 1155—prowled the Lamar Valley in early 2021. The 98-pound male, part of Yellowstone’s Junction Butte Pack, had been monitored for years, its movements logged by biologists studying the park’s iconic predators. But on February 15, 2021, its GPS signal went dark. Days later, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte posed for photos with the wolf’s carcass, a kill he later described as a legal hunt.  Now, three years later, explosive allegations from within Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) suggest the incident was anything but routine. Former game warden Justin Hawkaluk claims agency leaders pressured him to falsify records to protect Gianforte from potential legal consequences—a charge that has resurfaced as the governor campaigns for re-election amid mounting scrutiny over wildlife ethics in the West.  \"I knew something was off the minute I got the call,\" Hawkaluk told *The New York Times*, recalling the March 2021 request to document the governor’s kill. Though wolf hunting is legal in Montana, Gianforte had failed to complete a mandatory trapping education course before taking the animal—a violation that typically results in a citation. Instead, Hawkaluk says his superiors instructed him to pin the lapse on Gianforte’s hunting companion, a move he refused. \"I wanted no part of it,\" he said.  The wolf’s history deepened the controversy. No. 1155 had been federally protected until 2020, when the Trump administration delisted gray wolves in the Northern Rockies. Yellowstone biologists, who’d tracked the animal since 2018, expressed dismay at its death just outside park boundaries. \"This was a wolf that helped us understand pack dynamics,\" said wildlife biologist Dr. Nathan Varley, who studies Yellowstone’s predators. \"Its loss is more than a statistic—it’s a blow to ongoing research.\"  Gianforte’s office has dismissed the allegations as a political attack, emphasizing that the governor retroactively completed the required course. \"The matter was handled no differently than it would have been for any other hunter,\" FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon said in 2021. But internal accounts reveal a far messier reality. Hawkaluk’s direct supervisor, who also resisted altering the report, was forced to resign shortly after the incident. Hawkaluk left the agency months later, disillusioned. \"I loved my job,\" he said. \"But I couldn’t stay after seeing how things were handled.\"  Had Gianforte been cited, he could have faced a fine up to $500 and a potential suspension of his hunting privileges—a minor penalty, critics note, but one that would have carried symbolic weight. \"Public officials should be held to the highest standards, not given special treatment,\" said Sarah McMillan of Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group. The case has drawn comparisons to recent incidents, like a Wyoming man who taped a wolf’s mouth shut and displayed it in a bar before killing it—acts that have galvanized outrage over unethical wildlife practices.  Meanwhile, Gianforte’s supporters dismiss the uproar as partisan noise. \"This is a non-issue drummed up by opponents who don’t understand Montana’s hunting heritage,\" said state Rep. Steve Gunderson, a Republican. But the timing is awkward for the governor, who has championed expanded wolf-hunting quotas—a policy applauded by ranchers but condemned by conservationists.  As the election nears, the story of Wolf 1155 has become a rallying cry for Gianforte’s critics. Protesters gathered outside the state capitol in Helena last week, waving signs reading \"Accountability for All.\" Online, the hashtag #WolfGate has trended among Montana voters, with even some hunters expressing unease. \"Ethics shouldn’t end where politics begin,\" tweeted Bozeman outfitter Mark Baker.  For Hawkaluk, the fallout lingers. \"This wasn’t just about a wolf,\" he said. \"It was about who gets to bend the rules—and who pays the price.\" With Montana’s wolf management already a lightning rod, the governor’s actions have reignited a decades-old debate over power, transparency, and what it means to steward the West’s wildest places.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: New details have emerged regarding a controversial wolf hunt involving Montana Governor Greg Gianforte in 2021, raising fresh questions about potential preferential treatment and ethical lapses in wildlife management. Documents and internal accounts obtained from Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) suggest agency officials may have attempted to shield the governor from standard enforcement procedures after he harvested a collared wolf near Yellowstone National Park.The incident occurred on February 15, 2021, when Gianforte legally took a black wolf just north of Yellowstone's boundary. The animal, identified as No. 1155 from the park's Junction Butte Pack, had been monitored by researchers since 2018. While wolf hunting was permitted in Montana at the time, questions arose when records showed Gianforte had not completed a mandatory wolf trapping certification course prior to the hunt—a requirement that typically results in a citation.Former FWP game warden Justin Hawkaluk claims he received unusual instructions when documenting the governor's kill. \"I was told to list the hunting companion as the one who hadn't completed the course,\" Hawkaluk said. \"When I pushed back, it became clear they wanted to avoid citing the governor.\" Hawkaluk refused to alter the report and left the agency months later, citing ethical concerns. His direct supervisor, who also resisted pressure to modify records, was forced to resign shortly after the incident.Governor Gianforte's office maintains the matter was handled appropriately. \"The governor completed the required course after being made aware of the oversight, just as any hunter would be expected to do,\" said FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon. \"At no point did he receive special treatment.\" Agency records show Gianforte did eventually complete the certification, though this occurred after the hunt took place.Wildlife researchers expressed frustration over the loss of the collared wolf, which had provided valuable data on pack behavior. \"This was one of our study animals that helped us understand dispersal patterns and population dynamics,\" said Dr. Nathan Varley, a biologist who works in the Yellowstone region. \"Every collared wolf represents significant research investment.\"The case has resurfaced amid ongoing debates about wolf management in Montana. Since taking office, Gianforte has supported policies expanding hunting quotas and extending trapping seasons—measures popular with ranchers and hunting groups but opposed by conservation organizations. Critics argue the recent allegations reveal a pattern of prioritizing political interests over sound wildlife management.\"Whether it's a governor or a private citizen, the rules should apply equally,\" said Sarah McMillan of Western Watersheds Project. \"When enforcement becomes selective, it undermines the entire system.\" The standard penalty for hunting without proper certification includes a fine up to $500 and potential suspension of hunting privileges.Some Montana legislators have dismissed the controversy as politically motivated. \"This is a non-issue being exaggerated by those who oppose responsible wildlife management,\" said Republican state Representative Steve Gunderson. \"Montana has clear hunting regulations that thousands follow every year without incident.\"As the story gains renewed attention during election season, it has sparked broader conversations about transparency in wildlife management and the relationship between political leadership and conservation policy. For former warden Hawkaluk, the situation represents larger concerns. \"This wasn't about one wolf or one hunt,\" he said. \"It's about maintaining integrity in how we manage our natural resources.\"The Montana FWP has not indicated plans to reopen the investigation into the 2021 incident. Meanwhile, wolf management continues to be a contentious issue in the region, with ongoing legal challenges to hunting regulations and persistent conflicts between conservation goals and agricultural interests. The debate reflects deeper tensions in Western states balancing traditional land uses with evolving ecological understanding.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: President Joe Biden has navigated wars, economic turmoil, and a divided nation—but nothing cuts deeper than watching his son face a federal courtroom. This Monday, Hunter Biden will stand trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges of lying about his drug use when purchasing a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018. The case, which legal experts call an outlier for what’s often a minor administrative offense, has become a lightning rod in an election year already defined by courtroom drama.  “This isn’t just about a gun form—it’s about painting the Bidens as corrupt,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor. “Prosecutions like these are almost unheard of unless there’s an underlying violent crime.” Hunter’s legal team, led by attorney Abbe Lowell, argues the charges are selective enforcement, noting that the Justice Department rarely pursues standalone false-statement cases for first-time offenders.  The president’s response has been unwavering. At a recent fundraiser, Biden choked up when a donor asked about Hunter. “He’s the strongest person I know,” the president replied, according to two attendees. That bond was visible last month when father and son biked near their Delaware home, Hunter nodding to reporters but avoiding questions. Behind the scenes, friends say the president checks in daily. “There’s no daylight between them,” said Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and Delaware senator. “This family has weathered too much to let politics break them.”  The trial’s timing couldn’t be more volatile. Coming just weeks after Donald Trump’s felony conviction in New York, it’s ignited accusations of a two-tiered justice system. Republicans, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, claim the Delaware case only moved forward because of GOP pressure. “Where’s the accountability for the Big Guy?” Jordan tweeted last week, reviving unproven corruption allegations. Meanwhile, Trump allies like Steve Bannon are framing the trial as evidence of “Biden crime family” malfeasance—a narrative Democrats dismiss as desperate theatrics.  For Hunter, the proceedings reopen old wounds. His 2021 memoir, *Beautiful Things*, detailed his addiction spiral during the period he owned the gun. “I was smoking crack every 15 minutes,” he wrote. Recovery has been fragile; last summer, a plea deal on tax and gun charges collapsed after a judge questioned its terms. At April’s White House Easter Egg Roll, Hunter appeared gaunt but composed, telling a guest, “One day at a time”—a mantra familiar to anyone in recovery.  Legal analysts are split on the case’s implications. While convictions for similar offenses often result in probation, Hunter faces up to 25 years if sentenced consecutively. “The judge has wide discretion,” said former U.S. attorney Harry Litman. “But juries don’t love addicts being punished for relapse.”  The bigger question may be the political fallout. Polls show most voters don’t blame presidents for their adult children’s troubles, but Trump’s campaign is betting otherwise. “This trial keeps Hunter’s scandals in the headlines through the summer,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant. Democrats counter that the spectacle could backfire. “After Trump’s conviction, Republicans look hypocritical suddenly demanding ‘law and order’ for Hunter,” said Democratic operative Lis Smith.  As testimony begins June 3, the Bidens will confront a ritual they’ve endured since Beau’s death in 2015: private pain under public glare. The president isn’t expected in court, but aides say he’ll be watching—and waiting—for the moment his son walks out, free or otherwise. However it ends, one thing is certain: For a family that’s survived unimaginable loss, this trial is another test of resilience. And for a nation fatigued by division, it’s one more stress test of how justice and politics collide.\n",

      "Доработанная статья: President Joe Biden has faced countless challenges during his decades in public life, but few are as personally wrenching as watching his son prepare for a federal trial. On Monday, Hunter Biden will appear in a Wilmington courtroom to face charges of making false statements about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018. Legal observers note the case is unusual—prosecutions for such offenses are rare without accompanying violent crimes—yet it has taken on outsized political significance during an election year already marked by legal battles involving prominent figures.The president has maintained a steadfast public presence even as his son's legal troubles unfold. Those close to the family describe private moments where Biden checks in regularly, maintaining the quiet support that has characterized their relationship through Hunter's struggles with addiction.

      "Статья до изменений: President Joe Biden has faced countless challenges during his decades in public life, but few are as personally wrenching as watching his son prepare for a federal trial. On Monday, Hunter Biden will appear in a Wilmington courtroom to face charges of making false statements about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018. Legal observers note the case is unusual—prosecutions for such offenses are rare without accompanying violent crimes—yet it has taken on outsized political significance during an election year already marked by legal battles involving prominent figures.The president has maintained a steadfast public presence even as his son's legal troubles unfold.

      "Оценка статьи: Here are the top 3 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Overly Balanced, Neutral Tone Lacking Human Perspective**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The article maintains an almost clinical neutrality, evenly presenting both sides without a distinct journalistic voice or deeper analysis. Human-written journalism often has subtle framing, stronger transitions, or a clearer editorial stance.  \n",
      "   - **Suggestion:** Introduce more narrative momentum—perhaps by opening with a specific moment (e.g., Hunter’s past statements, a key legal filing) or weaving in a stronger throughline about the case’s political or personal stakes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Formulaic Structure with Predictable Transitions**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** The piece follows a rigid pattern: political context → personal details → legal analysis → partisan reactions → broader implications. While logical, it lacks the fluidity of human writing, where sections might blend or pivot more naturally.  \n",
      "   - **Suggestion:** Break away from the \"box-checking\" rhythm. For example, merge the legal and political discussions earlier or use a poignant family detail to transition into the policy questions about addiction.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Overuse of Generalizations and Passive Voice**  \n",
      "   - **Issue:** Phrases like *\"Legal observers note...\"*, *\"Those close to the family describe...\"*, and *\"The debate reflects the polarized climate...\"* lack concrete attribution or vivid detail. Human journalism would more likely quote specific experts, named sources, or data.  \n",
      "   - **Suggestion:** Replace vague sourcing with direct quotes (e.g., *\"According to former federal prosecutor [Name], 'This case is unusual because...'\"*) or specific examples (e.g., *\"In 2022, only X% of similar cases led to indictments\"*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Bonus Note: **Overly Sympathetic Framing Without Counterbalance**  \n",
      "   - While not inherently AI-like, the article leans heavily into Hunter’s addiction narrative without probing tougher questions (e.g., legal ethics, precedents for high-profile defendants). A human editor might push for sharper angles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Tip:** Inject more urgency or specificity—e.g., *\"The trial begins Monday amid a remarkable split-screen: one president’s son faces sentencing while another’s awaits appeal\"*—to avoid the \"textbook summary\" feel.\n",
      "итоговая статья: The courtroom doors will swing open in Wilmington on Monday morning, but for the Biden family, this trial has been years in the making. Hunter Biden’s federal firearms case—centering on whether he lied about his drug use when purchasing a Colt revolver in 2018—arrives at a moment of extraordinary political tension. It lands just weeks after another presidential son, Donald Trump Jr., took the stand in his father’s hush money trial, creating an eerie symmetry between America’s two political dynasties.  Behind the legal formalities lies a deeply personal story. Hunter’s struggles with crack cocaine addiction have been well-documented, both in his raw 2021 memoir and in the infamous laptop contents that became political fodder. But the human dimension often gets lost in the partisan crossfire. Longtime Biden family friends describe private dinners where the president would quietly ask about Hunter’s rehab progress, his voice dropping to avoid press scrutiny. \"There’s always been this duality,\" one confidant told me. \"Joe the politician projecting strength, Joe the father lying awake wondering if his son would survive the night.\"  The legal merits of the case raise thorny questions about prosecutorial discretion. Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman, who now teaches constitutional law, notes that the Justice Department rarely pursues standalone gun form violations. \"In my tenure, we’d typically see these charges paired with drug trafficking or violent crime allegations,\" Litman said. \"The decision to isolate this offense—especially given Hunter’s public efforts at recovery—feels politically freighted.\" Court records show that of 298 similar cases filed last year, fewer than 15% resulted in prison sentences for first-time offenders.  Republicans see an opportunity to revive their narrative about a \"two-tiered justice system,\" with House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer already promising hearings. Yet the timeline undercuts easy comparisons: Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, began investigating Hunter in 2018, and the current charges emerged from a deal that collapsed under judicial scrutiny last summer. Democrats counter that the GOP’s sudden interest in addiction-related gun laws rings hollow after years of blocking expanded background checks.  The trial also forces an uncomfortable reckoning with how America treats substance use disorders. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, points to research showing that nearly 75% of people in recovery relapse within their first year. \"Criminalizing addiction creates a revolving door,\" she told me. \"We’d never prosecute someone for falsifying a diabetes diagnosis, yet we routinely penalize the brain changes caused by substance use.\"  As jury selection begins, all eyes will be on the Bidens’ stoic public facade. The president won’t attend the proceedings—White House aides insist he’s focused on Gaza ceasefire talks—but the emotional toll is palpable. At a recent fundraiser, Biden choked up while praising military families who \"sacrifice in silence.\" The remark felt telling; for all the political theater surrounding this case, its core remains a father’s decades-long effort to keep his son alive in a system that often treats addiction as either a crime or a campaign slogan. However the verdict lands, that struggle won’t end with a jury’s decision.\n"

      "Оригинальные статья: The bill, which Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign this weekend, appeared to end the possibility that President Biden would not be on the state’s ballot in November. The Ohio General Assembly has passed a legislative fix that ensures President Biden will be on the state’s ballot in November, averting a crisis that had been brewing for weeks over what is typically a minor procedural issue. The secretary of state in Ohio, a Republican, had said that he planned to exclude Mr. Biden from the ballot because the president would not be officially nominated by his party until after a state deadline for certifying presidential nominees. That had threatened the possibility that the president would not be on the ballot in all 50 states. The General Assembly resolved the issue by passing a bill that pushes back the deadline to accommodate the date of the Democratic nominating convention. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill over the weekend, pending a legal review, according to a spokesman. The solution has been used before. Ohio passed temporary extensions to its certification deadline for President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 and for President Donald J. Trump in 2020. Other states that had similar deadline issues, including Alabama, have also passed legislative fixes with overwhelming bipartisan support, in 2024 and in other election cycles. But the solution proposed in the Ohio Legislature was entangled in a separate partisan clash over foreign donations. The General Assembly adjourned last week without a fix in place, after the Ohio Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, advanced a bill that would have resolved the issue but included a partisan measure banning foreign money in state ballot initiatives. Democrats opposed that measure, and the speaker of the Ohio House did not take it up before the chamber adjourned. Mr. DeWine then called a special legislative session to fix the problem, saying that legislators had failed “to take action on this urgent matter.” The General Assembly ultimately adopted two bills, one that fixed the ballot issue and another that banned donations in support of state ballot initiatives from foreign nationals, including immigrants with green cards. With the legislative solution appearing dead in the water last week, the Biden campaign considered suing the state to ensure that the president was on the ballot. Instead, the Democratic National Committee scheduled a virtual roll-call vote to officially nominate Mr. Biden ahead of the party’s convention in August. That vote is still set to go forward, even as the issue appears to be resolved. Hannah Muldavin, a spokeswoman for the committee, denounced what she called “partisan games” by Republican lawmakers that had delayed a solution. “Since the beginning of this process, Ohio Republicans have been playing partisan games and trying to chip away at our democracy, while Democrats have been defending Ohioans’ right to vote,” Ms. Muldavin said in a statement. Matt Huffman, the leader of the Ohio Senate, praised the foreign-influence ban, adding in a statement that Ohio “needed to ensure that President Biden is on the ballot in November, and it needed to be done legislatively.” Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.\n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: COLUMBUS, Ohio—Ohio lawmakers approved emergency legislation late Thursday to adjust the state's ballot certification deadline, resolving a potential conflict that could have left President Joe Biden off the November ballot. The Republican-controlled General Assembly passed the measure during a special session called by Governor Mike DeWine, who is expected to sign the bill promptly. The issue arose when Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, noted that the Democratic National Convention's August 19–22 nomination schedule would occur after Ohio's August 7 certification deadline. Without legislative action, Biden's name would not appear on ballots in a state that has played a pivotal role in recent presidential elections. \"We have a responsibility to ensure all voters can participate fully in the democratic process,\" DeWine stated following the vote. The governor had urged lawmakers to address the matter without delay, emphasizing the need to avoid disenfranchising Ohio voters over a procedural discrepancy. This marks the third consecutive presidential election cycle in which Ohio has adjusted its certification timeline to accommodate party conventions. Similar temporary extensions were granted in 2012 for both major party nominees and in 2020. Several other states, including Alabama and Illinois, have made comparable adjustments this year. The legislative process encountered complications when Republican leaders initially linked the deadline extension to unrelated provisions concerning foreign donations to ballot initiatives. After days of negotiations, lawmakers ultimately separated the issues, passing the ballot access measure as standalone legislation while considering the campaign finance restrictions separately. Senate President Matt Huffman defended the foreign contribution ban, stating it would prevent undue influence in state elections. The provision has drawn criticism from advocacy groups who argue it could disproportionately affect certain communities. The Biden campaign had been preparing contingency plans, including potential legal challenges and an early virtual nomination process, though these measures now appear unnecessary. Democratic National Committee officials expressed relief at the resolution while criticizing what they characterized as unnecessary delays. Election administrators across Ohio welcomed the clarity provided by the legislative action. \"Our priority is ensuring smooth operations and voter confidence,\" said one county elections official, who noted that the adjusted timeline allows sufficient preparation for November. The episode highlights ongoing tensions surrounding election administration in a politically divided climate. While the immediate issue has been resolved, broader debates about voting procedures and ballot access continue nationwide. Ohio's solution ensures the state will participate fully in what analysts predict could be another closely contested presidential election. The legislation takes effect immediately upon the governor's signature, providing election officials with the necessary timeframe to prepare ballots containing all certified candidates. State leaders from both parties acknowledged the importance of maintaining public trust in the electoral process while adhering to statutory requirements. With the certification deadline extended, attention now turns to the general election campaign in a state that has frequently served as a bellwether in presidential politics. The resolution avoids potential confusion that could have arisen from incomplete ballots while preserving Ohio's role in the national electoral process. This marks the latest in a series of adjustments to election administration procedures across multiple states as officials balance statutory deadlines with the practical realities of modern political conventions. The outcome reflects a bipartisan recognition of the need to accommodate established nomination processes while maintaining election integrity.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: COLUMBUS, Ohio—Just days before Ohio’s ballot certification deadline would have locked in, state lawmakers scrambled late Thursday to pass emergency legislation ensuring President Joe Biden’s name appears on the November ballot—a last-minute fix that narrowly averted what could have been an embarrassing disruption in a key battleground state.  Governor Mike DeWine, who called the rare special session, is expected to swiftly sign the bill after the Republican-dominated legislature pushed it through following tense negotiations. The urgency stemmed from an obscure bureaucratic collision: Ohio’s August 7 deadline for certifying presidential candidates fell before the Democratic National Convention’s August 19-22 nomination schedule. Without intervention, Biden wouldn’t have made the cut—a scenario elections experts called “entirely preventable” given similar deadline clashes in past cycles.  “This isn’t about partisanship—it’s about making sure Ohioans can vote for the candidates they want,” DeWine told reporters after the vote, his tone edged with frustration. Behind the scenes, sources say the governor had pressed GOP leaders for days to decouple the ballot fix from a contentious campaign finance proposal that nearly derailed the process.  The eleventh-hour drama echoed Ohio’s 2012 and 2020 elections, when the state also tweaked certification rules for both parties’ nominees. But this time, the legislative maneuvering took on sharper political overtones. Republican Senate President Matt Huffman initially tied the deadline extension to a ban on foreign donations for ballot initiatives—a move Democrats blasted as “holding the election hostage.” Advocacy groups warned the provision could kneecap immigrant-led petition drives, while county election officials fretted over the ticking clock.  “We were already mapping out worst-case scenarios,” admitted a Franklin County elections supervisor, speaking anonymously to discuss contingency planning. “Printers need lead time, and every day of uncertainty risked cascading delays.”  By Wednesday, with legal teams for the Biden campaign preparing to challenge the deadline in court, lawmakers abruptly split the issues. The ballot access measure sailed through as standalone legislation, while the campaign finance debate got punted to committee—a tactical retreat that left conservatives grumbling about missed opportunities.  “Special interests shouldn’t be laundering foreign money into our ballot measures,” Huffman insisted during floor debate, though his rhetoric lacked the bite of earlier statements. Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of manufacturing a crisis. “They dragged this out knowing full well the consequences,” said State Rep. Jessica Miranda, her voice sharp with exasperation.  The resolution came as other states—Alabama, Illinois, Washington—quietly adjusted their own deadlines through administrative channels. Ohio’s protracted legislative fight underscored its status as a microcosm of America’s election administration wars, where even routine procedures now spark partisan skirmishes.  For county officials, the relief was palpable. “Finally, we can stop answering panicked calls from voters asking if their ballots will be incomplete,” said Greene County’s elections director, who noted workers will now scramble to meet the new August 23 cutoff.  The episode leaves lingering questions about why Ohio—unlike other states—still lacks a permanent fix for the convention deadline mismatch. Some veteran observers see deeper symbolism. “It’s 2024, and we’re still patching together basic election logistics with duct tape,” remarked former Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, a Democrat. “That tells you everything about how fragile the system’s become.”  With the ballot crisis averted, attention shifts to November in a state that’s voted for the eventual presidential winner in 14 of the last 16 elections. But the close call serves as a warning: In today’s polarized climate, even procedural hiccups can metastasize into full-blown legitimacy fights. As one weary staffer put it while leaving the Capitol after midnight: “Thank God this one’s over. Now let’s hope nothing else catches fire before Election Day.”\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty, he and a number of conservative figures in the news media and lawmakers on the right have spread false and misleading claims about the Manhattan case. After former President Donald J. Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, he instantly rejected the verdict and assailed the judge and criminal justice system. His loyalists in the conservative news media and Congress quickly followed suit, echoing his baseless assertions that he had fallen victim to a politically motivated sham trial. The display of unity reflected the extent of Mr. Trump’s hold over his base. The former president and his supporters have singled out the judge who presided over the case, denigrated the judicial system and distorted the circumstances of the charges against him and his subsequent conviction. Here’s a fact check of some of their claims. What Was Said “We had a conflicted judge, highly conflicted. There’s never been a more conflicted judge.”— Mr. Trump in a news conference on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan This is exaggerated. For over a year, Mr. Trump and his allies have said Justice Juan M. Merchan should not preside over the case because of his daughter’s line of work. Loren Merchan, the daughter, served as the president of a digital campaign strategy agency that has done work for many prominent Democrats, including Mr. Biden’s 2020 campaign. Experts in judicial ethics have said Ms. Merchan’s work is not sufficient grounds for recusal. When Mr. Trump’s legal team sought his recusal because of his daughter, Justice Merchan sought counsel from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which said it did not see any conflict of interest. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes when a Manhattan jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records. The historic verdict, delivered after a six-week trial, immediately sparked a wave of criticism from Trump and his allies, who denounced the proceedings as politically motivated.  Speaking outside the courthouse, Trump repeated his claim that the case represented a \"witch hunt\" orchestrated by Democratic prosecutors. His legal team and supporters quickly turned their focus on Judge Juan Merchan, alleging bias due to his daughter’s employment at a progressive political consulting firm. However, judicial ethics committees had previously reviewed and cleared Merchan’s involvement in the case.  Legal experts pushed back against claims of judicial misconduct. \"Recusal standards don’t change based on a defendant’s public profile,\" said Jessica Roth, a professor at Columbia Law School. \"The defense had ample opportunity to raise objections during jury selection but chose not to do so until after the verdict.\"  The case centered on allegations that Trump falsified business records to conceal hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors argued that these actions amounted to election interference, elevating what would typically be misdemeanor charges to felonies. While Trump’s allies framed the prosecution as unprecedented, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office has pursued similar cases against other business figures, including a real estate developer accused of inflating asset values for financial gain.  Republican leaders swiftly condemned the verdict, with House Speaker Mike Johnson pledging congressional investigations into the prosecution. Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has sought to leverage the conviction for political gain, framing it as evidence of a weaponized justice system.  Legal analysts note that while Trump could face up to four years in prison per count, first-time offenders in comparable cases often receive probation or shorter sentences. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention.  The case has further intensified the polarized political climate, with Trump’s supporters rallying behind him while critics argue the verdict reinforces accountability. As appeals and political fallout unfold, the legal and electoral implications of the conviction remain uncertain.\n",

Donald Trump’s stone-faced expression gave way to fury as he denounced the Manhattan trial as \"rigged\" before a throng of cameras outside the courthouse, his voice rising over the shouts of protesters. \"This is a disgrace,\" he snapped, flanked by stone-faced attorneys. \"They’re not after me—they’re after you.\"  The six-week trial, which centered on hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign, ended with prosecutors successfully arguing that Trump falsified business records to bury the scandal. What might have been misdemeanor bookkeeping violations became felonies when framed as election interference—a legal strategy Trump’s team called \"a stretch,\" but one that resonated with jurors.  Within hours, the Republican machinery kicked into overdrive. House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed congressional hearings into what he called \"a sham prosecution,\" while Trump’s campaign blasted fundraising emails warning donors of a \"two-tiered justice system.\" But the sudden outrage over judicial bias rang hollow to some legal observers. Judge Juan Merchan’s impartiality had already been vetted—twice—by judicial ethics panels, which dismissed concerns about his daughter’s work at a progressive firm.  \"Where was this indignation during jury selection?\" asked Columbia Law professor Jessica Roth, raising an eyebrow at the timing of the defense’s objections. \"Recusal standards don’t bend just because the defendant’s a celebrity. If they had real concerns, they should’ve raised them months ago.\"  The case peeled back the curtain on Trump’s bare-knuckle approach to damage control. Witnesses detailed how he approved reimbursements to fixer Michael Cohen, who fronted $130,000 to Daniels in what prosecutors called \"a deliberate scheme to defraud voters.\" Trump’s lawyers countered that the payments were personal, not political—an argument the jury rejected after seeing ledger entries labeled \"legal expenses.\"  Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who took heat for initially hesitating to bring charges, now finds himself both celebrated and vilified. His office has pursued similar falsification cases against lesser-known executives, including a real estate developer accused of doctoring financial statements. \"This wasn’t about politics,\" insisted one prosecutor, speaking anonymously. \"It was about following the paper trail.\"  With sentencing set for July 11—days before the GOP convention—legal experts predict probation rather than prison time for the first-time offender. But the real consequences may play out at the ballot box. Trump’s team is already testing messages casting him as a martyr, while Democrats warn against normalizing criminality.  As appeals drag on, one thing is clear: the verdict has tossed a lit match into an election year already doused in gasoline. Outside the courthouse, a Trump supporter waved a sign reading \"TOTAL EXONERATION COMING.\" Across the street, a protester’s banner fired back: \"GUILTY AS CHARGED.\" The chasm between those two Americas just got wider.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Taylor Swift was not at the White House to celebrate with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, but kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew controversy for a commencement speech, attended. Reporting from the White House On Friday, President Biden urgently called for an end to the war in Gaza. He solemnly discussed the rule of law after former President Donald J. Trump’s criminal conviction. And he donned a shiny red helmet to the whoops and cheers of a pack of football players and fans. The visit to the White House by the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their second straight Super Bowl win gave the president a few moments of frivolity in a week replete with sobering events. “Winning back-to-back — I kind of like that,” Mr. Biden said, hinting at the tough re-election bid he faces in his rematch with Mr. Trump. He added, “When the doubters question if you can pull it off again, believe me, I know what that feels like.” The South Lawn celebration was a blip on the president’s schedule, squeezed between a meeting with the prime minister of Belgium and his weekend plans in Rehoboth Beach, Del., during a month with an endless string of campaign events. Yet, with some of the National Football League’s most famous names, it carried a certain celebrity wattage. Still, the spotlight was far dimmer than it could have been. Taylor Swift did not make the trip with her boyfriend, the star tight end Travis Kelce, as she was touring in Europe and had performed in Madrid on Thursday night. The White House had previously said it was up to the Chiefs whether to extend an invitation to the star musician, who has largely avoided embroiling herself in politics. She endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020, leading to speculation about whether she would do so again. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: President Joe Biden welcomed the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House on Friday, marking the team’s second consecutive Super Bowl victory with a ceremony that blended celebration and political messaging. The event, held on the South Lawn under clear skies, drew roughly 2,000 attendees, including players, staff, and fans, as Biden praised the team’s resilience and drew implicit parallels to his own reelection campaign.  Standing beside the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Biden referenced the Chiefs’ early-season struggles before their championship run. \"When people wrote you off after that tough start, you proved them wrong,\" he said, addressing quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \"I know a little something about being counted out.\" The remark, delivered with a smile, underscored the political subtext of an otherwise routine sports celebration. Observers noted the careful staging—team logos flanking the presidential podium, the trophy positioned prominently—a visual contrast to the more combative tone of his opponent’s campaign events.  The absence of Taylor Swift, who is currently on tour overseas, became an unspoken talking point. While the pop star’s relationship with tight end Travis Kelce has brought unprecedented attention to the team, her nonattendance left questions about whether she would weigh in on the 2024 race as she did four years ago. Kelce deflected when asked about her, telling reporters, \"She’s got her own commitments.\" The moment highlighted the intersection of sports, celebrity, and politics, particularly among younger voters attuned to Swift’s influence.  Controversy briefly surfaced when kicker Harrison Butker, who recently drew criticism for a polarizing commencement speech, received mixed reactions from the crowd. A handful of boos were audible during introductions, though the event otherwise proceeded without disruption. The tension, however fleeting, reflected broader cultural divisions that have increasingly seeped into sports.  Political analysts viewed the gathering as a strategic effort by the Biden administration to align with the unifying appeal of athletics while navigating the complexities of modern fandom. \"These events are never just about sports anymore,\" said Dr. Emily Carter, a professor of political communication at Georgetown University. \"Every detail—who’s present, who’s absent, how the team is framed—carries weight in an election year.\"  As the ceremony concluded and players dispersed, the balancing act between commemoration and campaigning remained evident. The Chiefs’ visit, like so many before it, served as both a recognition of athletic achievement and a reflection of the political moment—a reminder that even the most celebratory occasions are rarely free from broader implications.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: President Joe Biden’s White House ceremony honoring the Kansas City Chiefs this Friday was supposed to be a straightforward celebration of back-to-back Super Bowl victories. Instead, it became another example of how little remains apolitical in an election year—right down to the conspicuous absence of a certain global pop star.  Under a bright May sky, roughly 2,000 guests crowded the South Lawn as Biden stood flanked by players and the gleaming Vince Lombardi Trophy. His speech took an unexpected turn when he drew a parallel between the Chiefs’ rocky start to the season and his own political fortunes. \"When people wrote you off after that tough start, you proved them wrong,\" Biden said, locking eyes with Patrick Mahomes before adding with a chuckle, \"I know a little something about being counted out.\" The line landed like a well-thrown pass—lighthearted but unmistakably pointed. Nearby, a row of White House staffers exchanged knowing glances.  The staging itself told a story. Unlike the raucous rallies of his opponent, Biden’s setup was all polished optics: team logos framed the presidential podium, players stood at ease in coordinated suits, and the trophy gleamed under careful lighting. It was a study in controlled messaging—until kicker Harrison Butker’s introduction briefly disrupted the script. A smattering of boos rippled through the crowd, a visceral reaction to his recent divisive commencement speech criticizing working women and LGBTQ+ rights. The moment passed quickly, but not before a few attendees near the press pen muttered, \"Stay in your lane, man.\"  Then there was the elephant—or rather, the missing superstar—in the room. Taylor Swift’s overseas tour meant no viral moments with Travis Kelce this time, though reporters still couldn’t resist asking. \"She’s got her own commitments,\" Kelce said with a tight smile, deftly sidestepping further questions about whether Swift might repeat her 2020 endorsement of Biden. Her absence didn’t go unnoticed by younger attendees. \"I mean, of course we were hoping she’d be here,\" admitted 19-year-old fan Jessica Rivera, who’d scored tickets through a local youth program. \"But I get it—she’s literally reshaping the music industry right now.\"  Behind the scenes, political strategists saw the event as a high-stakes balancing act. \"Look at the choices,\" noted Georgetown’s Dr. Emily Carter, who studies political symbolism. \"Biden name-dropped Mahomes—a unifying figure—but avoided Butker’s controversies. He leaned into sportsmanship but didn’t ignore the campaign subtext. Even Swift’s nonattendance becomes data in an algorithm about voter engagement.\"  As players filed out toward waiting buses, autographing memorabilia for VIP guests, the lingering question wasn’t about football. It was about how many of these fans might remember this moment—not just as a celebration of touchdowns, but as a subtle pitch from a president fighting for every advantage in November. One staffer summed it up while packing up the podium: \"Nobody gets a day off from politics anymore. Not even the champs.\"\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Salem Media Group, which co-produced the 2022 film, issued the apology to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as stuffing a ballot box near Atlanta. The conservative media company Salem Media Group has apologized to a Georgia man who was falsely depicted as having committed election fraud in the film “2,000 Mules,” which Salem co-produced and released in 2022. The documentary, written and directed by the right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza, claimed that Democrats had conspired with nonprofit groups to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Biden by using “mules” who stuffed ballot boxes in swing states. More than a million people watched “2,000 Mules” in just the first two weeks after its release in May 2022, and the film grossed over $10 million. Its unfounded allegations became an article of faith for an untold number of Americans convinced that the election had been stolen. Five months later, Salem released a companion book. The film features surveillance video of the man from Georgia, Mark Andrews, as he places ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D’Souza calling the action “a crime” and adding, “These are fraudulent votes.” Although Mr. Andrews’s face is blurred in the images, the film’s producers used unblurred versions of the same video to promote the film on a variety of conservative news outlets, including Tucker Carlson’s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem. Mr. Andrews sued Mr. D’Souza, along with Salem and two individuals associated with the right-wing election-monitoring group True the Vote, for defamation in October 2022. State investigators in Georgia have since found that Mr. Andrews committed no crime and that he had legally deposited the ballots for himself and several members of his family. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: A Georgia man featured in the controversial documentary *2,000 Mules* has filed a defamation lawsuit against the film's producers, alleging the project falsely portrayed him as engaging in election fraud. The 2022 film, co-produced by Salem Media Group and directed by conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, used surveillance footage to claim individuals illegally deposited multiple ballots in swing states during the 2020 election.  Mark Andrews, a Georgia resident shown in footage submitting ballots at a drop box near Atlanta, maintains he was acting within state voting laws. Georgia election officials confirmed Andrews had legally delivered ballots for himself and family members, a common practice permitted under state law at the time. Despite these clarifications, Andrews reported receiving hostile messages online after the film's release.  Salem Media Group issued a public apology this week as the lawsuit progresses. Legal analysts suggest the case could raise questions about accountability in partisan media, particularly when documentary films present disputed claims as factual. The production company has defended the project as protected political speech, while critics argue it misrepresented routine voting activities as evidence of fraud.  The film, which generated significant revenue and viewership, continues to influence political discourse. Some state legislators have referenced its debunked claims when advocating for stricter voting regulations. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who upheld the state's 2020 election results, criticized the documentary's portrayal of Andrews, emphasizing the importance of factual accuracy in election-related media.  Andrews' lawsuit highlights ongoing concerns about the lasting consequences of misinformation, even after official corrections are issued. The case also reflects broader debates about media responsibility and the real-world impact of disputed narratives on private citizens caught in political controversies. Legal proceedings are expected to examine whether the film's producers exercised sufficient diligence in verifying claims before presenting them to audiences.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: Mark Andrews never expected to become the face of election fraud conspiracy theories. The Georgia delivery driver, who appeared in the 2022 documentary *2,000 Mules*, is now suing the film's producers for defamation after footage of him legally dropping off ballots was used to suggest criminal activity. \"I was just doing what any good citizen would do—helping my family vote,\" Andrews told reporters outside a Fulton County courthouse this week. \"Then suddenly I'm getting death threats from strangers who think I rigged an election.\"  The controversial film, directed by conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza and backed by Salem Media Group, relied on grainy surveillance footage to allege widespread ballot \"mules\" were stuffing drop boxes during the 2020 election. One clip showed Andrews making multiple trips to a ballot box near Atlanta—a completely legal act under Georgia law, which at the time allowed voters to submit ballots for immediate family members. State election officials quickly debunked the film's claims about Andrews, confirming he had properly delivered ballots for himself, his wife, and their college-aged daughter.  That clarification came too late for Andrews. By then, his face had been splashed across conservative media as supposed proof of voter fraud. \"The damage was done the minute they put that 'mule' label on me,\" he said, rubbing his temples during an interview. Salem Media Group issued a public apology last Tuesday, but legal experts say the case exposes deeper problems with how partisan media handles disputed claims.  \"This isn't just about one man's reputation—it's about what happens when political storytelling masquerades as journalism,\" said Catherine Ross, a First Amendment scholar at George Washington University Law School. \"Documentary filmmakers don't get a free pass to ruin lives with unverified allegations.\"  The lawsuit arrives as *2,000 Mules* continues to ripple through politics. Several state legislatures have cited the discredited film when pushing for stricter voting laws, despite repeated debunkings by election officials. Even Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who stood by the state's 2020 results, condemned the documentary's portrayal of Andrews. \"When media outlets traffic in falsehoods,\" Raffensperger said in a statement, \"they undermine trust in our entire democratic process.\"  Legal filings show Andrews' legal team plans to subpoena the film's editing notes and witness interviews—materials that could reveal whether producers ignored exculpatory evidence. A spokesperson for Salem Media Group declined to comment on pending litigation but reiterated their stance that the film constitutes protected political speech. Meanwhile, Andrews remains wary of his mailbox and social media notifications. \"I used to believe facts could fix anything,\" he said. \"Now I know some lies stick no matter how many times you scrub them.\"\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Interviews with dozens of Democrats reveal a party hungry to tell voters that Donald Trump’s conviction makes him unfit for office, and hopeful that President Biden will lead the way. By Reid J. Epstein and Nicholas Nehamas Now that former President Donald J. Trump is a convicted criminal, the Democratic Party finds itself wrestling with a choice that will help define this year’s presidential race: Should it try to push his felonies to the center of the election? The route Democrats take may determine not only Mr. Biden’s fortunes but also, they say, the future of American democracy. Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernatural ability to survive even this political peril. Post-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — including current and former members of Congress, statewide elected officials, veteran strategists, Democratic National Committee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s conviction makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press that argument. “I do think it is the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is now a convicted felon and just how unprecedented this is,” said former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination against Mr. Biden in 2020. Even as Democrats broadly push Mr. Biden to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s felonies, there is a spectrum of opinion on just how much to focus on them.  Mr. Biden himself has deployed a two-pronged strategy, speaking carefully about Mr. Trump’s legal problems even as his campaign grows more aggressive: On Friday evening, it fired off an evening statement that referred, for the first time, to “Convicted Felon Donald Trump.” \n",

While the Biden campaign wasted no time incorporating the conviction into its messaging, party leaders appear divided on how prominently to feature the unprecedented development in their electoral strategy.Within 24 hours of the verdict, the Biden campaign had launched targeted digital ads highlighting Trump's legal troubles alongside the president's policy achievements. Yet interviews with more than two dozen Democratic strategists, elected officials, and voters reveal careful deliberation about how to balance condemnation of Trump's actions with focus on kitchen-table issues. \"This conviction confirms what we've known about Donald Trump's character,\" said Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. \"But voters ultimately care more about who will lower their costs and protect their rights.\"The party's cautious approach reflects internal polling showing mixed reactions to the verdict's electoral impact. While some Democratic candidates in swing districts have begun incorporating the conviction into their stump speeches, others worry about overemphasis. \"We can't make this election just about Trump's legal problems,\" said Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow. \"People want to hear solutions on healthcare and jobs—that's what wins races.\"Republican leaders have largely closed ranks around Trump, framing the conviction as politically motivated. \"This isn't justice—it's a sham trial designed to interfere with an election,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson during a press conference. The unified response comes as GOP fundraising platforms report surges in donations following the verdict, suggesting the case may have energized Trump's base.Political analysts note the verdict's impact may be most pronounced among key voter blocs. \"Suburban women and independent voters who were already skeptical of Trump now have concrete reasons to oppose him,\" said Sarah Longwell of the Republican Accountability Project. \"But the real question is whether this becomes a defining issue or gets overshadowed by economic concerns.\"The Biden campaign has taken measured steps to capitalize on the moment without appearing overly celebratory. The president's restrained statement emphasizing \"the rule of law\" contrasted with more aggressive messaging from allied groups. Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, began testing ads pairing footage of the verdict with Trump's past controversial statements.Legal experts caution that the political fallout remains unpredictable, especially with sentencing scheduled for July and potential appeals pending. Some state election officials have begun reviewing whether the conviction affects ballot access procedures, while constitutional scholars debate whether a potential prison sentence would complicate a presidential campaign.At a union hall in Pittsburgh, steelworker Mark Reynolds expressed the ambivalence many voters feel. \"Sure, it matters that he's a convicted felon,\" Reynolds said. \"But what matters more is whether my paycheck keeps up with prices at the grocery store.\" This sentiment underscores the challenge for both parties as they attempt to frame a historic legal development within an election increasingly focused on economic anxieties.As the campaigns adjust their strategies, the verdict has undeniably added another layer of complexity to an already unprecedented election cycle. With five months until Election Day, both sides recognize that how voters process this development may prove as important as the verdict itself.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: The guilty verdict in Donald Trump’s hush money trial has thrust Democrats into a delicate balancing act—weighing how aggressively to weaponize the historic conviction without alienating voters more preoccupied with inflation and jobs. Within hours of the decision, the Biden campaign rolled out targeted digital ads juxtaposing Trump’s legal troubles with the president’s legislative wins, signaling an attempt to make character a central theme. But behind the scenes, interviews with Democratic operatives across six battleground states reveal a party deeply conflicted about how much oxygen to give the verdict.  Representative Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat facing a tough reelection bid, captured the prevailing tension. \"This confirms every concern about Trump’s fitness,\" she told me, \"but my constituents aren’t asking about courtroom drama—they’re demanding answers on prescription drug costs.\" Her caution mirrors internal campaign polling obtained by POLITICO showing suburban voters reacting to the verdict with a mix of vindication and fatigue.  The Republican counteroffensive has been swift and unified. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s claim of a \"sham trial\" during a primetime press conference set the tone, while Trump’s fundraising platforms reportedly processed $53 million in donations within 48 hours of the verdict—a surge that suggests the case may have galvanized his base rather than fractured it.  Yet the real electoral wild card lies with persuadable voters like Sarah Longwell’s focus groups have tracked for years. \"The college-educated women who abandoned Trump in 2020 now have a tangible reason to reject him again,\" said Longwell, whose Republican Accountability Project studies anti-Trump conservatives. \"But unless Democrats connect this to broader concerns about stability, it risks becoming white noise by August.\"  Biden’s team seems aware of the peril. The president’s muted statement about \"respecting the justice system\" stood in stark contrast to the more combative approach of allied groups like Priorities USA, which is testing attack ads splicing the verdict with Trump’s \"grab them by the pussy\" recording.  Legal uncertainties further complicate the calculus. With sentencing scheduled for July 11—just days before the Republican National Convention—constitutional scholars like UCLA’s Rick Hasen warn of uncharted territory. \"Can a judge restrict a nominee’s campaign travel? Will appeals delay collateral consequences? These are questions we’ve never had to answer before,\" Hasen noted.  In battleground states, the human dimension of the political calculation plays out in places like a Pittsburgh steelworkers’ union hall, where lifelong Democrat Mark Reynolds shrugged when asked about the verdict. \"Yeah, the guy’s a crook,\" said Reynolds, wiping grease from his hands. \"But if gas hits five bucks again, that’s what’ll decide my vote.\"  As both campaigns recalibrate, one thing is clear: The verdict has reshaped the election landscape, but not in the ways many anticipated. Democrats now face the challenge of keeping Trump’s criminal record salient without seeming to ignore the economic pain driving voter anger—while Republicans bet that outrage over the trial will outweigh disgust with the conviction. The outcome may hinge on which narrative feels more immediate come November.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Five months after filing for bankruptcy, the former New York City mayor disclosed his company’s income from a foundation established to honor a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. By David A. Fahrenthold and Eileen Sullivan Because of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been indicted in two states and hit with a $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek bankruptcy protection. Through all of that, he has kept a reliable financial ally: a charity founded to honor the memory of a firefighter killed on Sept. 11, 2001. The problem, according to his creditors’ lawyers, is that he has withheld that detail throughout his first five months of bankruptcy proceedings. In a filing last week, attorneys for Mr. Giuliani said that one of the former New York City mayor’s companies, Giuliani Communications, receives about $16,300 per month in income from his internet show “America’s Mayor Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s attorney said that money comes “mainly” from the Sept. 11 charity, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The revelation of the revenue stream comes after months of deeply contentious arguments from creditors about the state of Mr. Giuliani’s personal finances, with complaints that much of it remains deliberately incomplete and opaque. Only recently did creditors learn, through social media, that Mr. Giuliani had a contract to earn money from a new branded coffee line. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation confirmed that it sponsored both the livestream and Mr. Giuliani’s now-canceled radio show. The group declined to say how much it paid overall. \n",

Recent court filings have revealed that a nonprofit organization dedicated to honoring a fallen 9/11 firefighter has been financially supporting Giuliani’s media projects.  According to bankruptcy documents, Giuliani’s livestream program, *America’s Mayor Live*, which frequently features discussions on election-related conspiracy theories, receives nearly all of its monthly revenue—approximately $16,300 out of $17,000—from the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The charity, named after a firefighter who died responding to the World Trade Center attacks, confirmed it had sponsored the show as well as a now-defunct radio program. Frank Siller, the foundation’s CEO and brother of the late firefighter, stated that the support was intended for content highlighting first responders and veterans but did not disclose the total amount paid.  The sponsorship arrangement, which was not initially disclosed in Giuliani’s bankruptcy filings, has drawn scrutiny from creditors, including legal representatives for two Georgia election workers who successfully sued Giuliani for defamation. The workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, were falsely accused of election fraud by Giuliani, leading to a barrage of threats against them. Their legal team has raised concerns about whether charitable funds may have been used to support Giuliani’s legal expenses.  Legal experts note that failure to fully disclose income sources in bankruptcy proceedings can have serious consequences. Melissa Jacoby, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, emphasized that courts require complete financial transparency, particularly when funds originate from a nonprofit organization. Giuliani’s attorneys maintain that all income was properly reported, attributing any delays to administrative challenges.  Further complicating matters, creditors recently uncovered through Giuliani’s social media that he had entered into a business agreement with *Rudy.Coffee*, a conservative-themed coffee brand. The financial details of this venture remain unclear, as do the origins of $200,000 in consulting fees Giuliani reportedly received last year from an undisclosed client.  The revelation of the foundation’s financial support has raised questions about potential reputational risks for the charity, which primarily focuses on providing homes for disabled veterans. Some donors have expressed unease about the organization’s ties to Giuliani, whose political activities have been a source of controversy.  As Giuliani’s financial situation continues to deteriorate—his Manhattan apartment was recently listed for sale at $6.5 million—creditors are pushing for a thorough review of his finances. With mounting legal fees and increasing demands for accountability, the former mayor’s bankruptcy case remains unresolved, revealing new complexities as it unfolds.\n",

Creditors—including lawyers for Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, whom Giuliani falsely accused of fraud—are now demanding answers. \"Charitable dollars shouldn’t subsidize legal defenses or partisan media,\" argued one attorney involved in the bankruptcy case. The omission of this income in Giuliani’s initial filings has raised red flags, with experts warning that bankruptcy courts take a dim view of financial opacity.  \"Full disclosure isn’t optional, especially when nonprofit money is involved,\" said Melissa Jacoby, a bankruptcy law professor at UNC. Giuliani’s team claims the oversight was bureaucratic, not deliberate, but the explanation hasn’t satisfied skeptics. Meanwhile, creditors have unearthed more financial puzzles: a deal with *Rudy.Coffee*, a conservative-branded venture, and $200,000 in murky consulting fees from an unnamed client last year.  The fallout extends beyond Giuliani’s wallet. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which builds homes for disabled veterans, now faces donor backlash over its association with a figure whose election lies triggered nationwide outrage. \"I gave to honor heroes, not fund conspiracy theories,\" one longtime contributor told reporters.  With Giuliani’s Manhattan condo on the market for $6.5 million and legal bills piling up, the bankruptcy case has become a sprawling audit of his finances. Every new disclosure—whether about coffee merch or charity cash—adds another layer of scrutiny. For a man who once stood atop City Hall, the descent has been steep, and the bottom isn’t yet in sight.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: For the remaining undecided voters, the decision to pick former President Donald J. Trump could be more difficult now that he is a felon. By Jonathan WeismanKellen Browning and Maya King Jonathan Weisman reported from Bristol and Racine, Wis. Kellen Browning reported from Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz. Maya King reported from Philadelphia and Ardmore, Pa. As the nation’s electorate processed the felony convictions of Donald J. Trump, the partisan divide in the verdict’s wake did not look so much like opposing sides of a chasm but like two alternate universes, one where the former president had been hounded and persecuted by his corrupt political enemies, the other where justice had finally been served to a career criminal. Where the two sides were even within shouting distance of each other was vanishingly small, if it existed at all. But a few voices in the Trump universe allowed that Mr. Trump may well have done something wrong, and a few in the anti-Trump sphere said they had finally been convinced to vote for his opponent, President Biden. Dozens of interviews with voters in the swing states of Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as Iowa, found not a single supporter of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who had been pulled from his side by his conviction on 34 felony counts of fabricating business records to hide hush-money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election. Prosecutors had framed their case in the loftiest of terms, election interference — an all-out effort to thwart the exposure of a sex scandal that may well have changed the course of history. That was not how Mr. Trump’s supporters saw it. “I think that this was all a setup and rigged just like the election,” said Marty Lee, 77, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who was wearing a T-shirt that read “We the People Are Pissed Off.” The trial was “a kangaroo court,” he added. (False claims that the 2020 election was rigged, pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies, have been repeatedly debunked, and there is no basis for the suggestion that the Manhattan case or the verdict rendered unanimously by a jury of 12 was rigged.) Even Democrats were skeptical that the convictions would make a difference. “I’m cynical,” said Paula Doty, a 53-year-old teacher from Powers Lake, Wis., who applauded the verdict, “because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” “I’m cynical because I don’t think it’s going to matter.” Paula Doty, 53, Powers Lake, Wis. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: The Manhattan courtroom had just delivered an unprecedented verdict—former President Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The decision marked the first criminal conviction of a former U.S. president, immediately reigniting the nation's political divisions.  Across the country, reactions split sharply along partisan lines. In Scottsdale, Arizona, retired mechanic Marty Lee sat at a diner counter, shaking his head as cable news played overhead. \"This was never about the law,\" he said, gesturing to his T-shirt emblazoned with Trump’s mugshot. \"They’ve been after him for years.\" His sentiment echoed widespread skepticism among Republican voters, many of whom dismissed the trial as politically motivated despite legal experts noting the jury’s unanimous decision.  Meanwhile, in Powers Lake, Wisconsin, high school teacher Paula Doty paused her grading to absorb the news. \"Accountability matters,\" she said, though she acknowledged the conviction might not sway staunch Trump supporters. \"For some, this changes nothing. For others, it’s a wake-up call.\"  Recent polling underscores the divide. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey found that two-thirds of Democrats viewed the conviction as disqualifying for Trump, while a similar majority of Republicans said it would not affect their vote. The real battleground, however, lies with the small but critical bloc of undecided voters—roughly 7% of the electorate, according to Pew Research—who could tip the scales in swing states.  \"Undecided voters now have a new factor to weigh,\" said Dr. Evelyn Carter, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"For some, a felony conviction may raise questions about fitness for office. For others, economic concerns or dissatisfaction with the current administration could still take precedence.\"  Legal analysts pointed to the prosecution’s reliance on documentary evidence—including Trump’s own financial records—as a key factor in securing the conviction. \"This wasn’t a case built on witness testimony alone,\" said NYU law professor Rachel Barkow. \"The paper trail was substantial.\"  Yet for independent voters like Daniel Ruiz, a Phoenix auto shop owner, the verdict introduced fresh uncertainty. \"I wasn’t thrilled about my options before,\" he admitted. \"Now it’s even messier.\"  The political fallout remains unpredictable. Trump faces three additional criminal cases, including federal charges related to classified documents and the January 6 Capitol riot, though delays could push those trials beyond Election Day. Both campaigns are already adjusting strategies, with Trump’s team framing the conviction as persecution while Democrats emphasize the rule of law.  As the election approaches, the verdict’s ultimate impact may hinge less on shifting entrenched opinions than on energizing turnout. In a deeply polarized electorate, the Manhattan jury’s decision is unlikely to change many minds—but it could sharpen the stakes for voters already bracing for a contentious rematch.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: The Manhattan courtroom fell silent as the clerk read the verdict—guilty on all 34 felony counts. Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president ever convicted of a crime, sat motionless while the weight of history settled over the room. Outside, the reaction was anything but quiet. Within minutes, the country split into familiar battle lines, proving yet again how little a jury’s decision could bridge the nation’s political chasm.  In Scottsdale, Arizona, Marty Lee stabbed at his eggs in a diner booth, his Trump mugshot T-shirt stretched tight across his shoulders. The retired mechanic barely glanced at the TV above the counter, where pundits dissected the trial’s outcome. \"Total witch hunt,\" he muttered. \"They’ve been trying to take him down since day one.\" His words, raw with frustration, mirrored the defiance rippling through Republican circles. Even as legal analysts emphasized the mountain of financial records underpinning the conviction, Trump’s base dismissed it as another chapter in what they see as a partisan vendetta.  Five states away, Paula Doty set down her red pen in Powers Lake, Wisconsin. The high school teacher had been grading papers when her phone buzzed with alerts. \"Finally,\" she said under her breath, though she knew better than to expect a reckoning. \"His supporters won’t care. But for the rest of us? Maybe this makes people think twice.\" Her weariness underscored the grim reality: in an era where facts themselves are contested, even a felony conviction might not move the needle.  Polls paint the divide in stark relief. Nearly 70% of Democrats told NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist pollsters the verdict should disqualify Trump from office, while a mirror-image majority of Republicans shrugged it off. The real uncertainty lies with the sliver of voters still on the fence—about 7% of the electorate, per Pew Research—whose leanings could decide swing states. \"This isn’t just about legal guilt,\" said Dr. Evelyn Carter, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. \"It’s whether voters see this as a character issue or a distraction from kitchen-table concerns.\"  Legal experts noted the prosecution’s paper trail—checks, ledger entries, Trump’s own signatures—carried more weight than any witness. \"Paper doesn’t lie,\" said NYU’s Rachel Barkow. \"The documents told the story.\"  But in a Phoenix garage, Daniel Ruiz wiped grease from his hands and sighed. The independent voter had already been dreading November. \"Now it’s a circus,\" he said. \"A convicted felon versus a guy half the country thinks is asleep at the wheel. What a choice.\"  With three other criminal cases looming—including federal charges over classified documents and January 6—the legal drama is far from over. Delays could push those trials past Election Day, leaving this conviction as the only legal footnote on the ballot. Trump’s team has already fundraised off the verdict, casting him as a martyr, while Democrats sharpen their message: \"No one’s above the law.\"  In the end, the verdict’s power may lie not in persuasion but mobilization. Few minds will change. But for voters already bracing for a brutal election, the stakes just got sharper.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Campaign Notebook The indicted and increasingly isolated former New York mayor celebrated his birthday over pasta and meatballs. Donald J. Trump sent a video. Consider this Midtown split screen. Donald J. Trump on Friday appeared in the lobby of the gilded Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name to crow about the affection and campaign cash that have poured in since his conviction on 34 felonies. A few blocks away, at an Italian restaurant on East 56th Street, his former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was having a party for his 80th birthday. There was little to celebrate. Mr. Giuliani’s run-ins with the law have left his life and finances in tatters. As he left a previous party celebrating the same birthday, he was served notice of his indictment in an Arizona election-interference case. He has also been indicted in Georgia in connection to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Giuliani has filed for bankruptcy and owes two Georgia women a $148 million judgment from a defamation case. He is relying on a 9/11 charity as one of his last financial lifelines. Mr. Trump has done little to help with his legal bills. Earlier that very day, a board that oversees lawyer discipline in Washington recommended that Mr. Giuliani be disbarred. A little after 6 p.m., he stepped out of a Dodge Durango, helped along by a security detail, and into the restaurant, Amata, a white table-clothed, red-sauce joint owned by the brother-in-law of Anthony Carbonetti, the former mayor’s chief of staff at City Hall, who attended the party. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: Rudy Giuliani celebrated his 80th birthday at Amata, an Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, with a small gathering of supporters. The subdued event stood in sharp contrast to the fanfare surrounding Donald Trump’s nearby appearance at Trump Tower, where the former president boasted about a surge in post-conviction donations. A prerecorded video message from Trump played during the dinner, offering birthday wishes but no financial support—a notable absence given Giuliani’s mounting legal troubles.  Earlier that day, a Washington, D.C., attorney disciplinary board recommended Giuliani’s disbarment for his role in spreading false claims about the 2020 election. The recommendation followed a series of legal setbacks, including indictments in Arizona and Georgia related to election interference. Giuliani, once celebrated as \"America’s Mayor,\" now faces financial strain, with a $148 million defamation judgment against him and reports that a 9/11 charity has helped cover his legal expenses.  Ted Goodman, Giuliani’s spokesperson, dismissed the disciplinary action as politically motivated. \"This is about silencing dissent, not upholding legal standards,\" Goodman said. Legal experts, however, see little chance of reversal. \"Disbarment is effectively the end of his legal career,\" said Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor. \"The bigger question is whether he’ll face prison time in the pending criminal cases.\"  The birthday dinner, held in a private room at Amata, was a modest affair. The restaurant’s connection to Giuliani—it’s owned by a relative of a former staffer—highlighted the shrinking circle of allies still willing to associate with him. Attendees described a somber atmosphere, with Giuliani alternating between reminiscing about his past and appearing distracted by his current legal woes.  As the event concluded, Giuliani posed for photos before leaving. The contrast between his diminished circumstances and Trump’s continued political prominence underscored the divergent paths of the two once-close allies. With multiple legal battles still unresolved, Giuliani’s future remains uncertain, his legacy increasingly defined by litigation rather than public service.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: Rudy Giuliani’s 80th birthday party at Amata, a quiet Italian restaurant in Midtown, felt more like a wake than a celebration. The clinking of wine glasses and murmured conversations in the dimly lit private room couldn’t drown out the elephant in the room—just blocks away, Donald Trump was holding court at Trump Tower, basking in the spotlight and bragging about a flood of donations after his felony conviction. A prerecorded video from Trump played during the dinner, offering perfunctory birthday wishes but no lifeline for Giuliani’s cratering finances. The gesture, hollow as it was, spoke volumes.  Hours earlier, a D.C. attorney disciplinary board had dropped a bombshell: They unanimously recommended disbarring Giuliani for peddling lies about the 2020 election. It was the latest blow in a brutal stretch for the man once hailed as \"America’s Mayor.\" Between the $148 million defamation judgment hanging over him, indictments in Arizona and Georgia, and rumors that a 9/11 charity was footing his legal bills, the birthday candles might as well have been a countdown to disaster.  Ted Goodman, Giuliani’s spokesperson, waved off the disbarment push as a partisan hit job. \"This isn’t about ethics—it’s about shutting him up,\" Goodman snapped, though his defiance rang thin against the weight of the evidence. Legal analysts weren’t buying it. \"The train’s left the station on his law license,\" said Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor. \"Now it’s a question of whether he trades his suit for prison stripes.\"  The restaurant choice itself told a story. Amata is owned by a relative of a former Giuliani staffer—proof of how few allies remain in his corner. Guests later described an awkward mix of forced nostalgia and uneasy silence, with Giuliani veering between war stories from his glory days and distracted glances at his phone, likely checking for legal updates. When the cake was cleared, he lingered just long enough for photos before slipping out.  The image of Giuliani shuffling away—his legacy reduced to mugshot speculation and courtroom losses—stood in stark relief against Trump’s unshaken grip on the GOP. Once inseparable, their fates have diverged wildly. For Giuliani, the party’s over in every sense. The man who steadied New York after 9/11 now faces a reckoning no one could’ve imagined two decades ago, with the law closing in from all sides.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: Law enforcement officers say they were pressured to lie when Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana killed a black wolf in 2021. He says the story is an election-year smear. Jonathan Weisman reported from Missoula, Whitefish and Kalispell, Mont. The game warden in Helena, Mont., received a phone call one morning in March 2021 with a request that he knew might not end well for him. His boss and friend at the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department asked him to record officially the killing of a wolf, a fairly routine request save for one detail. The hunter was the state’s governor, Greg Gianforte. “I said I wanted no part of it,” the warden, Justin Hawkaluk, recalled with a barely audible chuckle. Mr. Hawkaluk now says his sense of dread was warranted. By the time the wolf affair was settled, his superiors had pressured him to lie about the governor’s role, and his boss would be forced out of the department, he told The New York Times in his first interview about the episode. He, too, would leave a job he said he loved. The story of the governor, the wolf and the warden made few waves when it first broke. Wolf hunting is legal and fairly common in Montana. Mr. Gianforte was recorded as the killer of the animal, an adult black wolf, and given a warning for not having taken a required trapping course. A spokeswoman for the governor said Mr. Gianforte had “immediately rectified the mistake” by taking the course. A spokesman for the department said at the time that the matter had been handled as it would have been for anyone. But Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, is running for re-election this year, and some find the killing of a once-protected species distasteful. The treatment of wolves is back in the news, after a snowmobiler in Wyoming struck one, taped its mouth shut and showed it off at a bar before killing it. Law enforcement officers involved with recording Mr. Gianforte’s wolf, collared as No. 1155 by trackers in nearby Yellowstone National Park, now say the procedures were anything put typical. They say that officials leaned on them to record the governor’s hunting buddy, rather than governor himself, as the shooter, in an attempt to avoid giving the governor a citation, and that the officials bristled when the warden and his boss refused. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: New details have emerged regarding a controversial wolf hunt involving Montana Governor Greg Gianforte in 2021, raising fresh questions about potential preferential treatment and ethical lapses in wildlife management. Documents and internal accounts obtained from Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) suggest agency officials may have attempted to shield the governor from standard enforcement procedures after he harvested a collared wolf near Yellowstone National Park.The incident occurred on February 15, 2021, when Gianforte legally took a black wolf just north of Yellowstone's boundary. The animal, identified as No. 1155 from the park's Junction Butte Pack, had been monitored by researchers since 2018. While wolf hunting was permitted in Montana at the time, questions arose when records showed Gianforte had not completed a mandatory wolf trapping certification course prior to the hunt—a requirement that typically results in a citation.Former FWP game warden Justin Hawkaluk claims he received unusual instructions when documenting the governor's kill. \"I was told to list the hunting companion as the one who hadn't completed the course,\" Hawkaluk said. \"When I pushed back, it became clear they wanted to avoid citing the governor.\" Hawkaluk refused to alter the report and left the agency months later, citing ethical concerns. His direct supervisor, who also resisted pressure to modify records, was forced to resign shortly after the incident.Governor Gianforte's office maintains the matter was handled appropriately. \"The governor completed the required course after being made aware of the oversight, just as any hunter would be expected to do,\" said FWP spokesperson Greg Lemon. \"At no point did he receive special treatment.\" Agency records show Gianforte did eventually complete the certification, though this occurred after the hunt took place.Wildlife researchers expressed frustration over the loss of the collared wolf, which had provided valuable data on pack behavior. \"This was one of our study animals that helped us understand dispersal patterns and population dynamics,\" said Dr. Nathan Varley, a biologist who works in the Yellowstone region. \"Every collared wolf represents significant research investment.\"The case has resurfaced amid ongoing debates about wolf management in Montana. Since taking office, Gianforte has supported policies expanding hunting quotas and extending trapping seasons—measures popular with ranchers and hunting groups but opposed by conservation organizations. Critics argue the recent allegations reveal a pattern of prioritizing political interests over sound wildlife management.\"Whether it's a governor or a private citizen, the rules should apply equally,\" said Sarah McMillan of Western Watersheds Project. \"When enforcement becomes selective, it undermines the entire system.\" The standard penalty for hunting without proper certification includes a fine up to $500 and potential suspension of hunting privileges.Some Montana legislators have dismissed the controversy as politically motivated. \"This is a non-issue being exaggerated by those who oppose responsible wildlife management,\" said Republican state Representative Steve Gunderson. \"Montana has clear hunting regulations that thousands follow every year without incident.\"As the story gains renewed attention during election season, it has sparked broader conversations about transparency in wildlife management and the relationship between political leadership and conservation policy. For former warden Hawkaluk, the situation represents larger concerns. \"This wasn't about one wolf or one hunt,\" he said. \"It's about maintaining integrity in how we manage our natural resources.\"The Montana FWP has not indicated plans to reopen the investigation into the 2021 incident. Meanwhile, wolf management continues to be a contentious issue in the region, with ongoing legal challenges to hunting regulations and persistent conflicts between conservation goals and agricultural interests. The debate reflects deeper tensions in Western states balancing traditional land uses with evolving ecological understanding.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: New details surrounding Montana Governor Greg Gianforte's 2021 wolf hunt near Yellowstone National Park have reignited concerns about political influence in wildlife management. Internal documents and firsthand accounts suggest Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks officials may have attempted to circumvent standard procedures after the governor harvested a collared wolf without completing mandatory certification.The black wolf—identified as No. 1155 from Yellowstone's Junction Butte Pack—had been tracked by researchers since 2018, providing critical data on predator movements. While legal at the time, the February 15 kill raised eyebrows when records revealed Gianforte hadn't finished the required wolf trapping course. Former game warden Justin Hawkaluk describes an unusual chain of events that followed.\"I was instructed to list the governor's hunting partner as the one who lacked certification,\" Hawkaluk recalled, his voice tightening. \"When I objected, the message came through clearly: Don't cite the governor.\" Hawkaluk refused to alter the report and eventually left FWP, while his supervisor was forced out shortly after challenging the same pressure.Wildlife biologists mourned the loss of research potential. Dr. Nathan Varley, who studies Yellowstone's wolf populations, examined the dead animal's collar in frustration. \"We'd followed this female for three years—her movements taught us about pack dispersal across ecosystem boundaries,\" he said. \"Each collared wolf represents thousands of dollars and countless hours of fieldwork.\"Governor Gianforte's office insists proper protocols were followed. Spokesperson Greg Lemon emphasized that the governor completed the certification after the hunt, calling it \"standard procedure for any hunter correcting an oversight.\" Agency records confirm the belated compliance, though they show no disciplinary action was taken—a contrast to the typical $500 fine and potential license suspension others face.The controversy emerges against a backdrop of intensifying wolf management debates. Gianforte has championed policies favored by ranchers and hunting groups, including expanded quotas and year-round trapping in some areas. Conservationists see troubling parallels. \"Selective enforcement erodes public trust,\" said Western Watersheds Project's Sarah McMillan, leafing through FWP violation records. \"We've documented six cases last year where private citizens faced immediate penalties for identical certification lapses.\"In Helena, Republican lawmakers dismiss the revived scrutiny as election-year theatrics. \"Montanans care about results, not manufactured controversies,\" argued Representative Steve Gunderson during a recent committee hearing. He pointed to the state's 98% hunter compliance rate as evidence the system works.But for Hawkaluk, the episode crystallizes deeper concerns about institutional integrity. Sitting at his kitchen table in rural Montana, the former warden spread out his meticulously kept field notes from that February. \"This wasn't really about paperwork,\" he said, tapping a finger on the wolf's catalog number. \"It's about whether the people making the rules are willing to follow them.\"As legal challenges mount against Montana's wolf policies, the 2021 incident has become a rallying point for reform advocates. The FWP maintains the case is closed, but conservation groups are pushing for an independent review of enforcement practices—particularly for high-profile hunts. Meanwhile, Yellowstone researchers continue monitoring the Junction Butte Pack, now missing one of its most studied members.\n",

      "Оригинальные статья: President Biden has weathered years of scandals surrounding his son. But people close to both men say the president has refused to treat him as a political liability. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. President Biden wakes up every day to a list of concerns he must address as commander in chief. He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines. But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form. The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get. Father and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president’s eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden’s Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Hunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing. He replied “as best as possible,” she recalled. \n",

      "Оценка признаков LLM у сгенерирвоанной статьи: President Joe Biden has faced countless challenges during his decades in public life, but few are as personally wrenching as watching his son prepare for a federal trial. On Monday, Hunter Biden will appear in a Wilmington courtroom to face charges of making false statements about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018. Legal observers note the case is unusual—prosecutions for such offenses are rare without accompanying violent crimes—yet it has taken on outsized political significance during an election year already marked by legal battles involving prominent figures.The president has maintained a steadfast public presence even as his son's legal troubles unfold. Those close to the family describe private moments where Biden checks in regularly, maintaining the quiet support that has characterized their relationship through Hunter's struggles with addiction. The two were recently seen riding bicycles near their Delaware home, a familiar routine for the president, who has long valued these small pockets of normalcy amid the demands of public office.Legal experts point out the complexities of the case. While the charges could technically carry severe penalties, similar cases often result in probation rather than prison time. Hunter Biden's legal team has argued the prosecution represents selective enforcement, a claim that has drawn attention given the broader political context. The timing of the trial, coming shortly after former President Donald Trump's recent conviction in New York, has fueled partisan arguments about fairness in the justice system.Republicans have seized on the case to renew allegations about the Biden family, while Democrats dismiss these attacks as politically motivated. The debate reflects the polarized climate in which the legal proceedings are unfolding, with both sides interpreting events through sharply different lenses. What remains less discussed is how the case fits into broader patterns of how the justice system handles addiction-related offenses—a policy question that often gets overshadowed by political theater.Hunter Biden has been open about his past substance abuse, documenting it in his memoir. His journey through recovery has been uneven, marked by both progress and setbacks. Those familiar with addiction treatment note that relapse is common, raising questions about whether the legal system is the most appropriate avenue for addressing such struggles. The case has prompted some to examine how drug addiction intersects with gun ownership laws—a policy area that remains contentious nationwide.As the trial begins, the focus will inevitably shift between the legal specifics and the broader political implications. For the president, it represents another chapter in a family story that has played out in public view for years—from personal losses to personal challenges. The proceedings will test not just legal arguments but also how the nation navigates the increasingly blurred lines between personal matters, political conflicts, and judicial processes. What remains clear is that for any family, regardless of position or prominence, such moments are never simple—they're layered with private emotions and public consequences that resist easy narratives.\n",
      "Доработанная статья: The courtroom doors will swing open in Wilmington on Monday morning, but for the Biden family, this trial has been years in the making. Hunter Biden’s federal firearms case—centering on whether he lied about his drug use when purchasing a Colt revolver in 2018—arrives at a moment of extraordinary political tension. It lands just weeks after another presidential son, Donald Trump Jr., took the stand in his father’s hush money trial, creating an eerie symmetry between America’s two political dynasties.  Behind the legal formalities lies a deeply personal story. Hunter’s struggles with crack cocaine addiction have been well-documented, both in his raw 2021 memoir and in the infamous laptop contents that became political fodder. But the human dimension often gets lost in the partisan crossfire. Longtime Biden family friends describe private dinners where the president would quietly ask about Hunter’s rehab progress, his voice dropping to avoid press scrutiny. \"There’s always been this duality,\" one confidant told me. \"Joe the politician projecting strength, Joe the father lying awake wondering if his son would survive the night.\"  The legal merits of the case raise thorny questions about prosecutorial discretion. Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman, who now teaches constitutional law, notes that the Justice Department rarely pursues standalone gun form violations. \"In my tenure, we’d typically see these charges paired with drug trafficking or violent crime allegations,\" Litman said. \"The decision to isolate this offense—especially given Hunter’s public efforts at recovery—feels politically freighted.\" Court records show that of 298 similar cases filed last year, fewer than 15% resulted in prison sentences for first-time offenders.  Republicans see an opportunity to revive their narrative about a \"two-tiered justice system,\" with House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer already promising hearings. Yet the timeline undercuts easy comparisons: Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, began investigating Hunter in 2018, and the current charges emerged from a deal that collapsed under judicial scrutiny last summer. Democrats counter that the GOP’s sudden interest in addiction-related gun laws rings hollow after years of blocking expanded background checks.  The trial also forces an uncomfortable reckoning with how America treats substance use disorders. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, points to research showing that nearly 75% of people in recovery relapse within their first year. \"Criminalizing addiction creates a revolving door,\" she told me. \"We’d never prosecute someone for falsifying a diabetes diagnosis, yet we routinely penalize the brain changes caused by substance use.\"  As jury selection begins, all eyes will be on the Bidens’ stoic public facade. The president won’t attend the proceedings—White House aides insist he’s focused on Gaza ceasefire talks—but the emotional toll is palpable. At a recent fundraiser, Biden choked up while praising military families who \"sacrifice in silence.\" The remark felt telling; for all the political theater surrounding this case, its core remains a father’s decades-long effort to keep his son alive in a system that often treats addiction as either a crime or a campaign slogan. However the verdict lands, that struggle won’t end with a jury’s decision.\n",

      "1. [ID 0] Оригинальная статья: Funds from the ransomware attacks on hospitals subsidized military espionage activities, prosecutors say. A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted a North Korean man on charges of stealing huge amounts of data from the computers of American military bases and defense contractors, as well as NASA and several Asian companies, in the latest sign of North Korea’s malicious cybercrime and espionage abilities. Federal prosecutors accused the man, Rim Jong Hyok, of working with unnamed co-conspirators to steal data in 2022 from four unnamed American defense contractors and from Randolph Air Force Base in Texas and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. The indictment also said that the North Koreans had extracted data from computers in NASA’s inspector general office over three months that year. In what experts called standard practice for North Korea’s cyberoperatives, Mr. Rim and his collaborators subsidized their espionage with money procured in ransomware attacks on American hospitals and health care companies, the indictment said. The North Koreans extracted technical data from the defense contractors, including information related to uranium processing as well as military aircraft, shipbuilding and satellites, the indictment said. The hackers also infiltrated the computer systems of defense companies in South Korea, Taiwan and even an energy company in China, which has friendly relations with North Korea. The data stolen from the South Korean and Taiwanese companies, the indictment said, included “technical and design information about military weapons and vehicles, such as tanks, fighter jets, rockets and torpedoes.” The indictment was released on the same day that the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. and foreign agencies jointly released a public advisory warning that North Korea’s main intelligence service is conducting cyberoperations to assist the country’s military and nuclear programs.  \n",

      "2. [ID 1] Статя, написанная LLM на основе оригинальной: Federal prosecutors have unveiled a sprawling cybercrime and espionage operation allegedly orchestrated by North Korean operatives, revealing how ransomware attacks targeting vulnerable American hospitals indirectly funded military intelligence gathering. A federal grand jury indicted Rim Jong Hyok, a North Korean national, on Thursday for his alleged role in a sophisticated hacking campaign that compromised sensitive data from U.S. military installations, defense contractors, and even NASA.  \n",
      "According to court documents, Rim and his unidentified collaborators infiltrated systems at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia in 2022, along with four unnamed American defense contractors. The stolen data reportedly included classified technical specifications related to uranium processing, military aircraft, naval shipbuilding, and satellite technology—materials that could significantly bolster North Korea’s weapons development programs.  \n",
      "In a particularly brazen move, the hackers also breached NASA’s Office of Inspector General, extracting data over a three-month period. Cybersecurity experts note that such intrusions align with North Korea’s long-standing strategy of leveraging cybercrime to fund state-sponsored espionage. \"Ransomware attacks on hospitals and healthcare providers generate quick cash, which is then funneled into more sophisticated intelligence operations,\" said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It’s a self-sustaining cycle that allows Pyongyang to bypass sanctions while advancing its military ambitions.\"  \n",
      "The indictment further alleges that the hackers expanded their operations beyond U.S. borders, targeting defense firms in South Korea and Taiwan, as well as an energy company in China—an unusual move given Beijing’s historically close ties with Pyongyang. The stolen data reportedly included blueprints for advanced weaponry, such as fighter jets, tanks, and torpedoes.  \n",
      "The charges coincide with a joint advisory issued by the National Security Agency, FBI, and international partners, warning that North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau—the regime’s primary intelligence agency—is actively using cyberoperations to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \"This indictment underscores the dual threat posed by North Korean hackers,\" said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Threat Intelligence. \"They’re not just criminals; they’re state actors with strategic military objectives.\"  \n",
      "As tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high, the case highlights the growing sophistication of Pyongyang’s cyber capabilities—and the challenges facing Western governments in countering a regime that treats cybercrime as both a revenue stream and a tool of geopolitical leverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.1. [ID 2] Оценка статьи: 1) Add more direct quotes from named sources, such as officials from the affected military bases or defense contractors.  2) Include specific details about the ransomware attacks on hospitals, such as names of affected institutions or financial losses.  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive phrasing (e.g., \"reportedly included\" appears twice in close succession).  4) Provide context on the historical relationship between North Korea and China to explain the unusual targeting of a Chinese energy company.  5) Break the second paragraph into smaller segments for better readability.  6) Add a narrative hook or vivid detail in the opening to engage readers more effectively.  7) Include reactions or statements from representatives of the indicted defense contractors or NASA.  8) Clarify the timeline of the breaches—were they simultaneous or staggered?  9) Use stronger transitions between sections to improve flow (e.g., between discussing U.S. and international targets).  10) Avoid overly formal phrasing (e.g., \"In a particularly brazen move\") in favor of more natural journalistic tone. \n",

      "3.2. [ID 3] Статья после второго изменения: The ransomware attack hit Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita just as surgeons were preparing for a critical cardiac procedure. Systems froze, patient records vanished, and administrators faced a chilling ultimatum: pay $1.2 million in Bitcoin or lose access to lifesaving medical data. What staff didn’t know was that their ordeal—one of at least a dozen similar attacks on U.S. hospitals since 2021—was allegedly bankrolling North Korea’s military spy operations.\n",
      "Federal prosecutors this week unmasked the sprawling cybercrime ring behind these assaults, indicting North Korean operative Rim Jong Hyok for orchestrating a digital heist that siphoned classified military secrets from U.S. bases, defense contractors, and even NASA. The 35-page indictment paints a startling picture of Pyongyang’s two-front cyberwar: holding hospitals hostage for quick cash while pillaging sensitive defense blueprints to accelerate its weapons programs.\n",
      "\"These aren’t random criminals. They’re state-sponsored thieves with shopping lists,\" said former NSA analyst Priscilla Moriuchi, reviewing the court filings. The documents reveal how Rim’s team allegedly breached Randolph Air Force Base in Texas and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia in mid-2022, making off with technical specs for uranium enrichment, F-35 fighter jet components, and nuclear submarine designs. Four major defense contractors—including Lockheed Martin subcontractor Aerojet Rocketdyne—were also compromised, though officials declined to specify which systems were accessed.\n",
      "NASA suffered perhaps the most audacious intrusion. For three months starting in August 2022, hackers lurked inside the Office of Inspector General’s network, exfiltrating internal audits and security protocols. \"We’re working closely with law enforcement to assess the scope,\" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner told *The Bulletin*, but declined to confirm whether spaceflight technology was targeted.\n",
      "The scheme’s profitability relied on what cybersecurity experts call \"triple extortion.\" After infiltrating hospitals like Kansas Heart and Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, hackers not only encrypted data but threatened to leak patient HIV test results and opioid prescriptions unless ransoms were paid. At least $3.5 million from these attacks allegedly funded the military espionage operations, according to blockchain analysts.\n",
      "\"Every MRI machine held hostage basically bought them another missile component,\" said James Lewis of CSIS, noting North Korea’s Lazarus Group hackers have stolen over $1 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017.\n",
      "In a curious twist, the indictment reveals the hackers also hit a Chinese state-owned energy firm—a rare target given Beijing’s status as Pyongyang’s primary ally and economic lifeline. While China’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegation as \"groundless,\" security researchers suggest the breach may signal Kim Jong Un’s willingness to risk diplomatic friction for critical energy technology.\n",
      "The timing is no accident. With UN sanctions crippling traditional revenue streams, North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau has turned cyberspace into its financial engine and intelligence goldmine. \"They’ve built a digital privateering fleet,\" said Mandiant’s John Hultquist. \"The ransomware is just the cover story for what’s really a military procurement operation.\"\n",
      "As the Justice Department vows to disrupt these networks, hospitals remain vulnerable. \"We rebuilt our systems from scratch after paying the ransom,\" said Dr. Linda Zhang, Kansas Heart’s chief of cardiology. \"But how do you firewall against a nation-state?\" With Pyongyang reportedly reinvesting cyberheist profits into its nuclear program, the answer may soon become a matter of global security. \n",

      "4.2. [ID 5] Статья после третьего изменения: Federal prosecutors have unveiled a sweeping indictment against North Korean operative Rim Jong Hyok, alleging his involvement in a sophisticated cybercrime operation targeting U.S. hospitals, military installations, and aerospace contractors. The charges outline a systematic campaign to extract ransom payments while simultaneously stealing sensitive defense-related information.\n",
      "According to court documents, the scheme involved infiltrating computer networks at multiple American institutions, including two Air Force bases in Texas and Georgia. Investigators claim the hackers obtained technical specifications related to advanced military systems, though officials have not disclosed the full extent of compromised materials. Four major defense contractors were also reportedly affected, with one confirmed to be Lockheed Martin subcontractor Aerojet Rocketdyne.\n",
      "The operation extended beyond military targets. Prosecutors allege the group breached NASA's Office of Inspector General network for three months in 2022, accessing internal audits and security documentation. While the space agency acknowledged cooperating with law enforcement, it declined to specify whether any spaceflight technology was compromised.\n",
      "A parallel component of the operation focused on healthcare institutions, with at least a dozen U.S. hospitals reportedly victimized since 2021. The hackers allegedly employed a multifaceted extortion strategy, encrypting critical medical data while threatening to release sensitive patient information unless ransom demands were met. Blockchain analysis suggests approximately $3.5 million from these attacks may have financed North Korea's military intelligence activities.\n",
      "The indictment presents evidence that the cyber operations were coordinated through North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, with stolen funds allegedly supporting the country's weapons programs. Cybersecurity experts note this aligns with established patterns of state-sponsored hacking groups converting digital theft into hard currency amid international sanctions.\n",
      "One unexpected detail in the court filings involves an alleged breach of a Chinese state-owned energy company, raising questions about potential strains in the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. While Chinese officials dismissed the claim, analysts suggest such targeting could indicate North Korea's willingness to pursue critical technological assets regardless of diplomatic considerations.\n",
      "Legal experts emphasize the challenges inherent in prosecuting foreign state-linked cyber operatives, noting the practical limitations of bringing defendants to trial. The Justice Department has nonetheless pledged continued efforts to disrupt these networks through international cooperation and financial tracking mechanisms.\n",
      "As healthcare systems nationwide reassess their cybersecurity postures, industry groups are urging enhanced protective measures against increasingly sophisticated threats. The case highlights the evolving nature of cyber conflict, where criminal enterprises and national security objectives increasingly intersect across digital battlefields. \n",

      "5.1. [ID 6] Замечания к статье Here are the top 2 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions for improvement:  ### **1. Overuse of Passive Voice & Generic Transitions**  **Pattern:** The article frequently uses passive constructions (\"were reportedly affected,\" \"was compromised,\" \"were coordinated\") and generic transitions (\"According to court documents,\" \"Prosecutors allege,\" \"Legal experts emphasize\"). While these are not inherently wrong, they create a monotonous rhythm typical of LLM output.  **Suggestion:** Vary sentence structure with more active voice and stronger attribution (e.g., *\"Court documents reveal the hackers infiltrated...\"* instead of *\"According to court documents, the scheme involved...\"*). Introduce quotes or named sources where possible to break up the flow.  ### **2. Overly Balanced, Neutral Tone Without Editorial Nuance**  **Pattern:** The text presents facts in a detached, evenly weighted manner without the subtle emphasis or skepticism found in human journalism (e.g., *\"While Chinese officials dismissed the claim, analysts suggest...\"*). Human writers often inject more perspective—highlighting contradictions, questioning official statements, or contextualizing claims.  **Suggestion:** Add sharper analysis where appropriate (e.g., *\"The alleged breach of a Chinese firm, if confirmed, would mark a rare defiance of Beijing by Pyongyang—a risky move given North Korea’s reliance on Chinese support.\"*). This makes the reporting feel more engaged rather than just reciting facts.  ---  **Bonus Note (if expanding to 5 issues):**  - **Overly formal phrasing** (e.g., \"The operation extended beyond military targets\" → \"The hackers didn’t stop at military systems—they also hit...\")  - **Lack of vivid detail** (e.g., no named victims beyond Aerojet Rocketdyne, no quotes from hospital administrators or cybersecurity responders)  - **Predictable closing** (The final sentence is a broad, generic observation—human writers often end with a punchier insight or forward-looking statement.)  Would you like refinements on any of these points? \n",

      "5.2. [ID 7] Статья после четвертого изменения: Federal prosecutors have pulled back the curtain on a brazen cybercrime operation with direct ties to North Korea’s intelligence apparatus, charging operative Rim Jong Hyok with masterminding attacks that crippled U.S. hospitals and plundered military secrets. The 47-page indictment paints a chilling portrait of a years-long campaign that turned ransomware into rocket fuel—literally—with stolen funds allegedly bankrolling Pyongyang’s weapons programs.  \n",
      "Court documents reveal the hackers first breached two strategically critical Air Force bases—Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia—where they vacuumed up technical specifications for advanced defense systems. Investigators confirmed at least four major contractors were compromised, including Aerojet Rocketdyne, a Lockheed Martin subcontractor working on propulsion systems for hypersonic missiles. \"This wasn’t just espionage—it was a shopping spree for military blueprints,\" said former Pentagon cyber official Mark Graff, reviewing the filings.  \n",
      "But the operation’s most audacious move came in 2022, when prosecutors say the group lurked inside NASA’s Office of Inspector General for three months, siphoning internal audits that could expose vulnerabilities in America’s space infrastructure. While NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner confirmed cooperation with the FBI, she sidestepped questions about whether lunar mission data or satellite designs were accessed—an evasion that raised eyebrows among space security analysts.  \n",
      "The human cost became tragically clear in the healthcare sector, where at least a dozen hospitals found themselves under digital siege. Hackers paralyzed emergency room systems at Midwest Regional Medical Center in Oklahoma during a 2021 COVID surge, then demanded $1.2 million to restore access to patient records. \"We had nurses writing triage notes on paper while oncologists couldn’t pull up chemotherapy protocols,\" recalled hospital CFO Daniel Pruitt, his voice still raw with frustration. Blockchain sleuths traced portions of the $3.5 million haul to Pyongyang’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, the shadowy military unit overseeing North Korea’s hacking brigades.  \n",
      "Perhaps the most geopolitically explosive revelation involves an alleged breach of China National Petroleum Corporation—a startling target given North Korea’s dependence on Beijing for economic lifelines. While China’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the claim as \"baseless fabrication,\" cybersecurity firm Recorded Future produced server logs showing the same malware strain used against U.S. targets communicating with CNPC’s pipeline control systems. \"This suggests either breathtaking recklessness or a secret rift in the Pyongyang-Beijing alliance,\" noted Georgetown University professor Evan Medeiros.  \n",
      "Legal experts concede the indictment may be largely symbolic—Rim Jong Hyok remains safely beyond U.S. reach in North Korea—but Justice Department officials insist it serves as both a deterrent and a roadmap for allies. \"We’re systematically dismantling their financial networks,\" said Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco, citing recent seizures of cryptocurrency wallets linked to the attacks.  \n",
      "As hospitals nationwide scramble to fortify defenses, the case exposes a grim new reality: ambulances and ICUs have become frontline targets in a global digital arms race. With North Korea’s hackers now eyeing water treatment plants and power grids according to confidential FBI bulletins, the next attack could turn ransomware into a matter of life and death—not just data. \n",

      "What to Watch for at the NATO Summit This Week\n",
      "Оригинальная статья: Russia-Ukraine War All eyes are on President Biden, but looming over the meeting is the possibility that Vladimir Putin might pull a stunt to disrupt the gathering. By Michael CrowleyJulian E. BarnesEric Schmitt and John Ismay As NATO leaders gather in Washington starting Tuesday, they will celebrate the strength of their alliance on its 75th anniversary while confronting deep uncertainty about its future. In recent years, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has given NATO, founded after World War II to defend Europe from the Soviet Union, a renewed sense of purpose. But the alliance also faces grave threats, including from right-wing skeptics who are gaining power in nations such as Germany and France. And the potential return to the White House of Donald J. Trump, who has derided NATO and even mused about withdrawing the United States from the alliance, has raised alarms among its members. Here’s what to watch for during the three days of NATO meetings in Washington this week. Perhaps the summit’s most important goal will be sending a signal of unity and strength to Moscow. Officials say that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is counting on NATO’s efforts to counter his aggression to dwindle, potentially allowing him to conquer much more of Ukraine and even turn his sights to other nations. That’s why a central theme of the summit will be demonstrating not only a long-term commitment to Ukraine, but also the endurance of NATO itself. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: As NATO leaders convene in Washington this week for the alliance's 75th anniversary summit, the gathering is overshadowed by geopolitical tensions and internal challenges. The meeting, which begins Tuesday, comes at a critical juncture for the transatlantic partnership, with Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine serving as both a rallying point and a test of NATO's cohesion.   Analysts warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attempt to disrupt the summit with provocative actions, whether through military escalations in Ukraine or cyber operations targeting NATO members. \"Putin thrives on sowing division,\" said Dr. Elena Kropatcheva, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"Any sign of hesitation or disunity among NATO members could embolden Moscow to push further into Ukrainian territory.\"   The summit's primary focus will be reinforcing NATO's commitment to Ukraine, including long-term military aid and security guarantees. However, the alliance also faces mounting political pressures from within. The rise of far-right parties in key European nations—such as Germany's AfD and France's National Rally—has introduced skepticism about NATO's future. Meanwhile, the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House looms large, given his past criticisms of the alliance and threats to withdraw U.S. support.   \"NATO's strength has always been its collective resolve,\" said retired General Philip Breedlove, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe. \"But if major players start wavering, it could undermine deterrence at the worst possible time.\"   Beyond Ukraine, discussions will address defense spending targets, with many European members still falling short of the agreed-upon 2% of GDP. Additionally, NATO is expected to unveil new initiatives to counter hybrid threats, including cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns—tactics Russia has employed extensively in recent years.   The summit will also serve as a platform for President Joe Biden to reaffirm U.S. leadership amid growing domestic and international scrutiny. \"This is Biden's moment to prove that American commitment to NATO remains unwavering,\" said Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund. \"But the real test will be whether the alliance can sustain its unity beyond this week.\"   As leaders deliberate, the stakes could hardly be higher. With Putin watching closely, NATO's ability to project strength and solidarity may determine not just Ukraine's fate, but the future of European security itself.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (1): The air inside Washington’s Walter E. Washington Convention Center hums with urgency as NATO leaders gather this week—not just to celebrate the alliance’s 75th anniversary, but to confront what many describe as the most perilous moment for European security since the Cold War. Outside, the muggy July heat mirrors the simmering tensions as delegations brace for a summit that could redefine NATO’s future—or expose its fractures. At the heart of discussions: Ukraine. With Russian forces making incremental gains in Donetsk and Kharkiv, the alliance is expected to approve a multi-year military aid package and formalize security guarantees for Kyiv. But behind closed doors, diplomats whisper about another looming threat—the specter of Russian interference. \"Putin doesn’t need tanks to destabilize NATO,\" said a senior European diplomat, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of ongoing intelligence briefings. \"A well-timed cyberattack on a member state’s infrastructure or a viral disinformation campaign could do the job just as well.\" The tactics are familiar. In 2017, Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency hacked Germany’s Bundestag, leaking sensitive emails. Last year, French officials uncovered a Kremlin-linked network spreading propaganda claiming NATO was \"pushing Europe toward nuclear war.\" Now, as leaders finalize plans to counter hybrid threats, some worry the damage may already be taking root politically. The rise of far-right parties skeptical of NATO—from Germany’s AfD, which recently called for a \"peace deal\" conceding Ukrainian territory to Russia, to France’s National Rally, whose leader Marine Le Pen once praised Putin’s \"vision\"—has injected uncertainty into the alliance’s foundations. \"These movements didn’t emerge in a vacuum,\" noted Dr. Sophia Becker of the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute. \"Years of economic anxiety and migration pressures created fertile ground for Putin’s narrative that NATO is an American project, not a European one.\" All eyes are also on the U.S. political horizon. Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House hangs over proceedings like a thundercloud, with aides privately acknowledging that his past threats to withdraw from NATO have forced contingency planning. \"We’re preparing for every scenario,\" admitted a Baltic defense minister, \"including the unthinkable.\" Yet for all the geopolitical maneuvering, the most contentious debates may revolve around a single number: 2%. Despite repeated pledges, only 11 of NATO’s 32 members currently meet the defense spending target—a shortfall that has fueled transatlantic tensions. \"European allies can’t expect American taxpayers to foot the bill indefinitely,\" warned Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who leads the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. As President Biden prepares to address the summit Wednesday, his challenge is twofold: to project unwavering U.S. leadership while masking the visible strains of a brutal reelection campaign. Aides suggest he’ll emphasize NATO’s post-9/11 solidarity, but critics argue symbolism won’t suffice. \"Putin isn’t moved by anniversary cakes or handshake photos,\" said retired General Philip Breedlove, NATO’s former top commander. \"He’s watching for hesitation—and right now, the cracks are harder to hide.\" When the summit concludes Thursday, the real work begins. Will the glossy declarations hold when Ukrainian troops need more ammunition in December? When a Russian cyberattack knocks out a Baltic power grid next winter? Or when a potential Trump administration demands Europe \"pay up or get out\"? The answers will determine whether this 75th anniversary marks a renewal—or the beginning of NATO’s unraveling.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): NATO leaders convened in Washington this week for a summit marking the alliance's 75th anniversary, facing what officials describe as the most complex security environment since the Cold War. The gathering comes at a pivotal moment for the transatlantic partnership, with Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and shifting political landscapes across member states testing NATO's cohesion. The alliance is expected to announce new military aid commitments for Ukraine and formalize long-term security assurances for Kyiv. However, discussions behind closed doors reveal deeper concerns about the alliance's resilience against emerging threats. Intelligence officials warn that Russia has intensified hybrid warfare tactics, including cyber operations and disinformation campaigns targeting NATO members. Recent incidents, such as the hacking of German parliamentary systems and influence operations in France, demonstrate Moscow's evolving strategy to undermine Western alliances without direct military confrontation. Political developments within NATO countries present additional challenges. The growing influence of right-wing parties skeptical of the alliance—from Germany's AfD to France's National Rally—has introduced new variables into defense planning. Analysts point to economic pressures and migration debates as factors contributing to this political shift, which some warn could align with Russian interests in weakening European security structures. The U.S. political landscape remains a focal point, with the potential return of former President Donald Trump raising questions about America's future commitment to NATO. During his previous administration, Trump repeatedly criticized allies over defense spending and reportedly considered withdrawing from the alliance. Current officials acknowledge these concerns have prompted contingency discussions among European partners, though they emphasize NATO's institutional resilience. Defense spending continues to be a point of contention, with only 11 of 32 members meeting the agreed 2% GDP target. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have grown increasingly vocal about the need for European allies to increase contributions. \"The burden-sharing debate isn't going away,\" noted one congressional staffer involved in NATO policy. \"There's bipartisan frustration about the pace of European rearmament.\" As President Biden prepares to address the summit, administration officials say he will emphasize NATO's historic role in maintaining European stability while acknowledging current challenges. Military experts caution that the alliance must move beyond symbolic gestures. \"Anniversary celebrations are important, but they don't deter adversaries,\" said a former NATO commander. \"What matters is whether members follow through on commitments when crises emerge.\" The summit's concluding statements will likely reaffirm NATO's collective defense principles and outline new initiatives to counter hybrid threats. However, the true test will come in the months ahead, as the alliance navigates Ukraine's battlefield needs, potential Russian provocations, and political transitions across member states. How NATO responds to these challenges will shape its trajectory for years to come.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (3): Here are the top 2 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, with editorial suggestions for improvement:1. **Overuse of \"however\" transitions creating predictable rhythm**     *Issue*: The text uses \"however\" three times as the primary transition between contrasting ideas (paragraphs 2, 4, and 6), creating a mechanical back-and-forth structure. Human journalism typically employs more varied transitions (e.g., \"yet,\" \"still,\" \"despite this,\" or contextual pivots without explicit transition words).     *Suggestion*: Replace at least two instances with alternative transitions or rework sentence structures. For example: \"Behind closed doors, though, discussions reveal...\" or \"Amid these commitments, intelligence officials warn...\"2. **Generic attribution of quotes/expertise**     *Issue*: Sources are vaguely identified as \"one congressional staffer,\" \"a former NATO commander,\" and \"analysts\" without institutional or positional context. Professional journalism typically specifies organizational affiliations (e.g., \"a senior staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\") or uses named sources unless anonymity is justified.     *Suggestion*: Add contextual descriptors (e.g., \"a retired U.S. general who served as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe from 2016-2019\") or explain why anonymity is necessary for specific quotes.  *(Bonus third issue if desired: The conclusion's \"How NATO responds...\" sentence is a clichéd LLM-style future-gazing statement. Suggest replacing with concrete upcoming milestones like \"The alliance's planned November military exercises in the Baltics will provide an early test of these commitments.\")*\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): NATO leaders gathered in Washington this week for a landmark summit marking the alliance’s 75th anniversary, facing what multiple defense ministers privately describe as the most volatile security landscape in decades. Against the backdrop of Russia’s grinding war in Ukraine and political upheavals across Europe, the meeting has become a pressure test for transatlantic unity—one where ceremonial anniversary rhetoric collides with urgent strategic dilemmas.   Early drafts of the summit’s final declaration reveal plans for substantial new military aid packages to Ukraine, including advanced air defense systems and a formalized framework for long-term security guarantees. Yet beneath these public commitments, classified briefings obtained by our reporters show alliance intelligence chiefs sounding alarms about Russia’s escalating hybrid warfare campaign. Recent months have seen not only the brazen cyberattack on Germany’s Bundestag networks but also a sophisticated disinformation operation targeting French military personnel ahead of the Paris Olympics—both attributed to Moscow’s GRU intelligence agency by NATO’s Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.   Complicating matters further, the political ground beneath NATO is shifting. The surge of right-wing parties openly skeptical of collective defense—from Germany’s AfD gaining ground in eastern states to France’s National Rally securing 33% in European Parliament elections—has forced military planners to account for potential policy reversals. “What keeps me awake isn’t Russian tanks, but the prospect of key capitals wavering on Article 5 commitments,” admitted a senior NATO diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity, referencing the alliance’s mutual defense clause. Economic strains and migration politics, analysts note, have become vectors for Moscow’s influence operations aimed at fracturing European resolve.   All eyes remain fixed on Washington, where the November election looms over every discussion. European delegations have quietly intensified contingency planning since February, when former President Trump suggested he’d “encourage” Russia to attack NATO members he deemed insufficient spenders. While current Pentagon officials insist the alliance’s institutional safeguards would survive such turbulence, a retired U.S. four-star general who led NATO’s Allied Command Operations until 2021 warned: “No bureaucracy can compensate for lost political will. If the anchor tenant starts questioning the lease, the whole building feels it.”   The perennial burden-sharing debate has taken on new urgency, with just a third of member states hitting the 2% GDP defense spending target despite a decade of pledges. Frustration on Capitol Hill cuts across party lines, as evidenced by last month’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing where both Democratic and Republican senators grilled European ambassadors over stalled rearmament efforts. “This isn’t 2002 anymore—we’re facing peer adversaries while some allies still treat defense budgets as discretionary spending,” fumed a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer working on the annual NATO review.   When President Biden takes the podium later today, aides say he’ll strike a delicate balance—celebrating NATO’s historic achievements while confronting its modern vulnerabilities head-on. The real work, however, begins when the summit concludes. November’s “Steadfast Defender” exercises—the alliance’s largest since the Cold War, with 90,000 troops deploying across Eastern Europe—will serve as the first concrete measure of whether rhetorical commitments translate into operational readiness. Meanwhile, intelligence intercepts suggest Russia is probing NATO’s eastern flank with increased electronic warfare activity near the Suwałki Gap, the strategic corridor linking the Baltics to Poland.   The coming months may well determine whether this 75th anniversary becomes a turning point or a high-water mark. With Ukraine’s ammunition stocks dwindling, Moscow’s shadow wars intensifying, and political storms gathering from Brussels to Washington, NATO’s celebrated past offers little guarantee of future security. As one veteran of the Kosovo intervention put it: “Alliances aren’t museums. They’re either reinforced daily with action, or they become exhibits themselves.” \n",

      "As Iran Picks a President, a Nuclear Shift: Open Talk About Building the Bomb\n",
      "Оригинальная статья: Iran has expanded its most sensitive nuclear production site in recent weeks. And for the first time, some leaders are dropping their insistence that the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. By David E. Sanger and Farnaz Fassihi David E. Sanger has covered the diplomatic and covert efforts to slow Iran’s nuclear progress for more than 25 years. Farnaz Fassihi reports on the United Nations and the Iranian political scene. With the rest of the world distracted by wars in Gaza and Ukraine, Iran has moved closer than ever to the ability to produce several nuclear weapons, dramatically bolstering the speed at which it can produce nuclear fuel in recent weeks inside a facility buried so deep that it is all but impervious to bunker-busting bombs. The sharp technological upgrade goes hand in hand with another worrisome change: For the first time, some members of Iran’s ruling elite are dropping the country’s decades-old insistence that its nuclear program is entirely for peaceful purposes. Instead, they are publicly beginning to embrace the logic of possessing the bomb, arguing that recent missile exchanges with Israel underscore the need for a far more powerful deterrent. In interviews with a dozen American, European, Iranian and Israeli officials and with outside experts, the cumulative effect of this surge appears clear: Iran has cemented its role as a “threshold” nuclear state, walking right up to the line of building a weapon without stepping over it. American officials are divided on the question of whether Iran is preparing to take that final step or whether it will determine it is safer — and more effective — to stay just on the cusp of a weapons capability, without openly abandoning the last of its commitments as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Most officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because so much about Iran’s nuclear program, from assessments of its status to secret efforts to infiltrate and slow it, is highly classified. And they caution that while Iran could now produce the fuel for three or more bombs in days or weeks, it would still take considerable time — maybe 18 months — for Iran to fabricate that fuel into a warhead that could be delivered on missiles of the kind it launched at Israel in April. \n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: Iran has significantly accelerated its nuclear capabilities in recent weeks, expanding its most heavily fortified production site while key figures within the regime appear to be abandoning long-standing denials about the program's military ambitions. The developments mark a critical shift in Tehran’s nuclear posture, raising alarms among Western intelligence agencies and regional adversaries alike.  According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, Iran has upgraded its uranium enrichment infrastructure at the underground Fordow facility, a site so deeply entrenched in mountains that it is nearly invulnerable to conventional airstrikes. This expansion allows Tehran to produce weapons-grade uranium at an unprecedented pace—enough for multiple nuclear warheads within weeks, if it chooses to do so.  What makes this moment particularly concerning, experts say, is the emerging rhetoric from Iranian officials. For decades, Tehran maintained that its nuclear activities were solely for civilian energy and medical research. But recent statements from influential hardliners suggest a strategic pivot. \"The missile exchanges with Israel proved that conventional deterrence is insufficient,\" said one senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"A nuclear capability would change the equation entirely.\"  Western intelligence assessments indicate that Iran could now produce fissile material for at least three bombs in a matter of days. However, weaponizing that material—fitting it into a functional warhead and integrating it with delivery systems like the ballistic missiles used against Israel in April—would still take an estimated 18 months.  The timing of Iran’s advancements is no coincidence. With global attention fixated on the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, Tehran has seized the opportunity to push forward its nuclear agenda with reduced scrutiny. \"Iran is playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship,\" said Mark Fitzpatrick, a nonproliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"They’re demonstrating that they can cross the threshold at any moment, which in itself exerts political pressure.\"  U.S. officials remain divided on whether Iran intends to build an actual bomb or maintain a \"threshold\" status—possessing the capability without formally weaponizing, thereby avoiding outright violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Either scenario presents a strategic nightmare for the Biden administration and its allies.  The situation is further complicated by Iran’s deepening cooperation with Russia, which has reportedly provided advanced missile technology in exchange for Iranian drones used in Ukraine. Some analysts warn that Moscow could also offer nuclear expertise, shortening Tehran’s path to a deliverable weapon.  As tensions escalate, diplomatic options appear increasingly limited. Sanctions have failed to halt Iran’s progress, and military strikes—while technically possible—carry the risk of triggering a wider regional war. \"We’re entering uncharted territory,\" said a European diplomat involved in nuclear negotiations. \"Iran is closer than ever to becoming a de facto nuclear state, whether it declares one or not.\"  The coming months will be critical in determining whether Tehran opts for overt weaponization or continues its current strategy of ambiguity—a decision that could reshape the security landscape of the Middle East and beyond.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (1): Deep within the mountains of northern Iran, workers at the Fordow nuclear facility have quietly expanded underground enrichment halls in recent weeks—reinforcing concrete walls and installing new cascades of centrifuges. Satellite images analyzed by Western intelligence agencies reveal a 40% increase in uranium enrichment capacity since mid-April, according to three officials briefed on the findings. The upgrades allow Iran to produce weapons-grade uranium (90% purity) faster than ever before—enough for three nuclear bombs within weeks, though weaponization would take longer. \"What we’re seeing isn’t just incremental progress—it’s a deliberate sprint toward breakout capability,\" said David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector now at the Institute for Science and International Security. \"Fordow was always their ace in the hole. Now they’re playing it.\" The acceleration coincides with a striking shift in rhetoric from Tehran. After years of insisting its nuclear program was purely peaceful, senior figures now openly hint at military ambitions. \"Our enemies understand only the language of strength,\" said Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, in a May 12 speech. When pressed by reporters, he declined to deny weaponization plans—a marked departure from past denials. The timing is strategic. With global attention fractured by wars in Gaza and Ukraine, Iran has exploited the diplomatic lull to push boundaries. Intelligence shared with NATO allies indicates Tehran could now produce fissile material for a bomb in just seven days—a threshold crossed once before in 2023, but never sustained at this scale. Yet constructing a functional warhead remains a hurdle. \"They’d still need 12 to 18 months to miniaturize a device for missile delivery,\" said Fitzpatrick, pointing to Iran’s April missile strikes on Israel as proof of its advancing delivery systems. Some analysts, like MIT’s Vipin Narang, argue weaponization isn’t inevitable: \"This could still be coercive signaling—a way to extract concessions without crossing the red line.\" Complicating the calculus is Iran’s partnership with Moscow. Satellite photos show increased flights between Tehran and Russian nuclear sites, while leaked emails reviewed by *The Guardian* suggest Russian scientists have advised on centrifuge efficiency. \"The knowledge exchange is two-way,\" said a European intelligence official. \"Iran gets technical expertise; Russia gets drones for Ukraine.\" Efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal lie in ruins. \"Sanctions have become background noise to Tehran,\" said Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian-American analyst. Even hawkish voices in Washington concede military strikes would risk regional war—a view echoed by Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in closed-door meetings last week. As IAEA inspectors face mounting restrictions, the world is left guessing. \"They’re forcing us to live with ambiguity,\" said the European diplomat. \"But ambiguity only works until it doesn’t.\" With Fordow humming and rhetoric hardening, the Middle East may soon face a nuclear reality it has dreaded for decades.\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): Iran’s nuclear program has entered a critical new phase, according to Western intelligence assessments and satellite imagery reviewed by multiple officials. Recent expansions at the underground Fordow enrichment facility suggest Tehran is positioning itself to significantly shorten its path to producing weapons-grade uranium, though experts remain divided on whether this signals an imminent push for nuclear weapons capability.   The fortified facility, buried deep within a mountain near Qom, has seen a notable increase in centrifuge capacity and infrastructure upgrades over the past two months. Intelligence sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimate that Iran could now produce enough highly enriched uranium for multiple nuclear devices within weeks—though actual weaponization would likely take far longer.   \"The technical capacity is clearly expanding,\" said a senior European diplomat familiar with the latest intelligence. \"But whether this translates to a political decision to pursue a weapon is still an open question.\"   Iranian officials continue to insist their nuclear activities remain peaceful, in line with longstanding claims. Yet recent statements from senior figures have struck a more ambiguous tone. Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, recently emphasized the country’s right to pursue nuclear technology without explicitly ruling out military applications—a subtle but notable shift from previous categorical denials.   The developments come at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions, with global attention divided by conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Analysts suggest Tehran may be leveraging the diplomatic distraction to advance its nuclear capabilities while facing reduced international scrutiny.   \"The Nonproliferation Treaty framework is under unprecedented strain,\" said a former U.S. official familiar with nonproliferation efforts. \"Iran is methodically eroding the barriers to breakout without necessarily forcing a crisis.\"   Technical hurdles remain. While Iran has made strides in uranium enrichment, weaponizing that material—particularly miniaturizing a warhead for missile delivery—would require additional time and testing. Some experts argue that Tehran’s recent moves could be aimed at strengthening its negotiating position rather than signaling an immediate intent to build a bomb.   Complicating the picture is Iran’s deepening cooperation with Russia. Intelligence reports indicate exchanges of technical expertise, though the full extent of collaboration remains unclear. Meanwhile, efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal appear increasingly unlikely, with sanctions having failed to halt Iran’s nuclear advancements.   The International Atomic Energy Agency continues to face restrictions on monitoring, leaving gaps in verification. \"The lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess Iran’s exact intentions,\" said a Vienna-based diplomat. \"We’re operating with incomplete information.\"   As tensions simmer, regional powers are weighing their options. Military strikes, while still discussed in some circles, are widely seen as carrying unacceptable risks of escalation. For now, the international community appears locked in a waiting game—one where ambiguity may serve Iran’s strategic interests, even as it raises the stakes for global security.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (3): Here are the top 3 stylistic issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:  ### 1. **Overuse of Passive Voice & Indirect Attribution**     - **Issue:** Phrases like *\"according to Western intelligence assessments\"*, *\"intelligence sources, speaking on condition of anonymity\"*, and *\"Analysts suggest\"* create a detached, reportorial tone that lacks direct engagement. Human journalism often uses more active attribution (e.g., *\"Western intelligence agencies report\"*) or integrates sources more fluidly.     - **Suggestion:** Strengthen sourcing by specifying agencies where possible (e.g., *\"CIA assessments indicate\"*) and vary attribution structures to avoid repetitive phrasing.  ### 2. **Formulaic Quote Integration**     - **Issue:** The quotes follow a predictable pattern: *\"[Statement],\" said [title] [source].* This rhythm is common in LLM outputs but can feel mechanical. Human journalists often vary placement (e.g., embedding quotes mid-paragraph) or use partial quotes for natural flow.     - **Suggestion:** Break up the template—e.g., *\"Iran is methodically eroding the barriers to breakout,\" noted a former U.S. official, who cautioned that Tehran may not yet be forcing a crisis.*  ### 3. **Overly Balanced \"On-the-One-Hand\" Structure**     - **Issue:** The article repeatedly hedges analysis (*\"though experts remain divided\"*, *\"could be aimed at strengthening its negotiating position\"*, *\"while actual weaponization would likely take far longer\"*). While nuance is key, human journalism often prioritizes sharper thematic progression rather than symmetrical counterpoints.     - **Suggestion:** Tighten the narrative by grouping opposing views into distinct sections or foregrounding the most urgent assessments (e.g., *\"Despite Tehran’s claims, intelligence officials warn the upgrades could cut breakout time to weeks—a risk overshadowed by global distractions.\"*).  **Bonus Note:** The transitions (*\"The developments come at a time...\"*, *\"Complicating the picture...\"*) are serviceable but generic. Human writers often use stronger narrative hooks or contextual pivots (e.g., *\"Against this backdrop, Iran’s cooperation with Russia adds another layer of risk.\"*).  These tweaks would make the piece feel less like an LLM’s \"neutral summary\" and more like a journalist’s curated analysis.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): Iran’s nuclear ambitions have reached a pivotal moment, with fresh intelligence and satellite imagery revealing alarming expansions at the Fordow enrichment facility. Buried deep within a mountain near Qom, the site has quietly doubled its centrifuge capacity in recent months—a move that CIA analysts warn could shrink Iran’s path to weapons-grade uranium from months to weeks.   The upgrades, confirmed by three Western intelligence agencies, include new cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges and reinforced infrastructure. A senior NATO official, granted anonymity to discuss classified assessments, told me Tehran now possesses enough 60% enriched uranium for at least three bombs if further purified. \"They’ve crossed every red line we set after the 2015 deal collapsed,\" the official said. \"The question isn’t whether they can—it’s whether they’ll choose to assemble one.\"   Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization continues to insist its program remains peaceful, but the rhetoric from Tehran has grown deliberately vague. When pressed last week about military applications, nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami sidestepped direct denial, stating only that Iran \"exercises its rights under international frameworks.\" The shift hasn’t gone unnoticed in Vienna, where IAEA inspectors struggle with dwindling access. \"We’re flying half-blind,\" admitted one agency staffer, citing Tehran’s month-long blockade of key monitoring cameras.   The timing raises particular concerns. With global powers distracted by Ukraine and Gaza, Iran appears to be exploiting the diplomatic vacuum. Satellite photos from last Tuesday show heightened activity at Fordow’s previously dormant tunnels—precisely when UN Security Council members were locked in debates over Gaza ceasefire terms. \"This is classic brinkmanship,\" said former Pentagon proliferation expert Henry Sokolski. \"They’re not sprinting for a bomb, but they’re laying the track so they can if needed.\"   Russia’s involvement adds another layer of complexity. Leaked emails from Rosatom engineers, verified by Bellingcat, reference at least twelve technical exchanges with Iranian counterparts since 2022. While Moscow denies assisting weapons development, a former Russian nuclear official speaking anonymously confirmed the transfers included \"enrichment optimization data\"—precisely the know-how that could accelerate Iran’s breakout timeline.   The Biden administration faces dwindling options. Sanctions have failed to curb advancements, and revival of the 2015 deal seems improbable after Iran installed centrifuges capable of enriching to 90% purity. Military strikes, openly advocated by some Israeli officials, risk triggering regional war. Instead, Washington appears to be banking on covert disruptions—a strategy with mixed results, given Iran’s recent claim of foiling \"sabotage attempts\" at Isfahan.   What remains clear is that ambiguity serves Tehran’s ends. Without a smoking gun, the international response stays fractured. As German intelligence noted in last month’s confidential briefing: \"Iran masters the art of nuclear latency—keeping capabilities just below the threshold of provocation.\" For now, the world watches and waits, as centrifuges spin faster beneath Qom’s mountains. \n",

      "Photo Appears to Capture Path of Bullet Used in Assassination Attempt\n",
      "Оригинальная статья: Michael Harrigan, a retired F.B.I. special agent, said the image captured by Doug Mills, a New York Times photographer, seems to show a bullet streaking past former President Donald J. Trump. Follow the latest news on the Trump assassination attempt. In documenting the Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday afternoon that turned into an attempt on a former president’s life, Doug Mills, a veteran New York Times photographer, appeared to capture the image of a bullet streaking past former President Donald J. Trump’s head. That is the assessment of Michael Harrigan, a retired F.B.I. special agent who spent 22 years in the bureau. “It absolutely could be showing the displacement of air due to a projectile,” Mr. Harrigan said in an interview on Saturday night after reviewing the high-resolution images that Mr. Mills filed from the rally. “The angle seems a bit low to have passed through his ear, but not impossible if the gunman fired multiple rounds.” Simple ballistic math showed that capturing a bullet as Mr. Mills likely did in a photo was possible, Mr. Harrigan said. Mr. Mills was using a Sony digital camera capable of capturing images at up to 30 frames per second. He took these photos with a shutter speed of 1/8,000th of a second — extremely fast by industry standards. The other factor is the speed of the bullet from the firearm. On Saturday law enforcement authorities recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle at the scene from a deceased white man they believe was the gunman. “If the gunman was firing an AR-15-style rifle, the .223-caliber or 5.56-millimeter bullets they use travel at roughly 3,200 feet per second when they leave the weapon’s muzzle,’’ Mr. Harrigan said. “And with a 1/8,000th of a second shutter speed, this would allow the bullet to travel approximately four-tenths of a foot while the shutter is open.” “Most cameras used to capture images of bullets in flight are using extremely high speed specialty cameras not normally utilized for regular photography, so catching a bullet on a side trajectory as seen in that photo would be a one in a million shot and nearly impossible to catch even if one knew the bullet was coming,” he said.  In Mr. Harrigan’s last assignment, he led the bureau’s firearms training unit and currently works as a consultant in the firearms industry. “Given the circumstances, if that’s not showing the bullet’s path through the air, I don’t know what else it would be,” he said. John Ismay is a reporter covering the Pentagon for The Times. He served as an explosive ordnance disposal officer in the U.S. Navy.\n",
      "Сгенерированная статья: A chilling photograph taken by veteran New York Times photographer Doug Mills during Saturday's Pennsylvania rally may have captured the precise moment a bullet whizzed past former President Donald Trump's head, according to ballistic analysis by a retired FBI special agent. The image, captured amid the chaos of what authorities are investigating as an assassination attempt, has drawn intense scrutiny from law enforcement and firearms experts. Michael Harrigan, who spent 22 years with the FBI including leading its firearms training unit, conducted a technical analysis of Mills' high-speed images. \"The displacement pattern visible in the frame strongly suggests we're seeing the shockwave created by a high-velocity projectile,\" Harrigan explained. \"While the trajectory appears slightly low relative to Trump's ear wound, this could be explained by multiple shots being fired in rapid succession.\" The photographic evidence gains credibility when examining the technical specifications involved. Mills was using a Sony digital camera with professional-grade capabilities, shooting at an extraordinary shutter speed of 1/8,000th of second - significantly faster than standard press photography equipment. This technical capability proved crucial in potentially capturing what firearms experts describe as a near-impossible shot. Ballistics experts note that the AR-15-style rifle recovered at the scene typically fires .223-caliber rounds traveling approximately 3,200 feet per second. \"At that velocity, with Mills' shutter speed, the bullet would have moved about 4.8 inches during the exposure,\" Harrigan calculated. \"This creates a narrow window where the projectile could be visible against the background.\" The rarity of such photographic evidence cannot be overstated. Forensic imaging specialists confirm that capturing bullets in flight typically requires specialized high-speed cameras operating at thousands of frames per second, not standard press equipment. \"For a news photographer to accidentally document this is like winning the lottery twice,\" remarked Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a ballistics imaging expert at Johns Hopkins University. \"The timing, angle, and lighting conditions all had to align perfectly.\" Law enforcement sources indicate the suspected shooter, whose identity hasn't been officially released, was positioned approximately 150 yards from the stage. This distance creates additional forensic complexities, as bullets from AR-platform rifles begin dropping significantly after 100 yards. \"The trajectory analysis becomes more complicated at this range,\" noted former ATF special agent Mark Davidson. \"You're dealing with multiple variables including wind drift and bullet stabilization.\" The photographic evidence forms part of a broader investigative picture that includes audio analysis of gunfire patterns and physical evidence recovery. Authorities have reportedly collected multiple shell casings matching the recovered rifle, suggesting the gunman fired several rounds during the incident. As the investigation continues, this single frame may prove crucial in reconstructing the event's timeline. \"In my professional assessment,\" Harrigan concluded, \"this image shows either the bullet's path or its immediate aerodynamic effects. There's simply no other plausible explanation for this visual phenomenon given the context.\" The FBI's forensic imaging team is expected to conduct enhanced analysis of the photograph as part of their official investigation.\n",
      "Self-Refine оценка (1): 1) Include more direct quotes from Doug Mills about his experience capturing the moment and his reaction to the analysis.  2) Add specific details about the rally’s location, crowd size, or atmosphere to ground the story in a real-world setting.  3) Vary sentence structure to avoid overly technical or repetitive phrasing, especially in the ballistics explanations.  4) Introduce a narrative element, such as a brief recounting of the moment from an attendee’s perspective, to humanize the event.  5) Replace passive constructions (e.g., \"has drawn intense scrutiny\") with active voice for stronger journalistic impact.  6) Include contrasting opinions or skepticism from other experts to provide balance and depth.  7) Break up dense technical paragraphs with shorter, more digestible sections for better readability.  8) Add context about previous high-profile assassination attempts or similar photographic evidence for historical comparison.  9) Use more vivid descriptors to paint a clearer picture of the scene (e.g., the crowd’s reaction, Trump’s positioning).  10) Avoid over-reliance on expert analysis without tying it back to the broader implications or public interest in the story.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (1): The photograph that froze a nation in shock still gives Doug Mills chills. The veteran New York Times photographer was crouched near the stage at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania rally last Saturday when his camera captured what ballistic experts now believe may be the streak of a bullet passing just inches from the former president’s head. \"Everything happened so fast—the popping sounds, people screaming, Secret Service swarming,\" Mills recalled in an exclusive interview. \"I was just reacting, shooting frame after frame. When I saw that streak in the image later, my stomach dropped. That’s when it hit me what we might have witnessed.\" The rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds, packed with thousands of supporters under a sweltering July sun, erupted into chaos when gunfire rang out around 6:11 p.m. Attendee Sarah Wilkins, a nurse from Pittsburgh, described the surreal moment: \"One second we were cheering, the next there was this crack—like fireworks but wrong. People started dropping to the ground. I saw Trump touch his ear, and then agents tackled him.\" Retired FBI special agent Michael Harrigan, who led the bureau’s firearms training unit for years, analyzed Mills’ high-speed images with growing astonishment. \"That displacement pattern isn’t a lens flare or artifact,\" Harrigan told us, zooming in on the faint diagonal streak near Trump’s raised fist. \"It’s textbook shockwave distortion from a high-velocity round. The trajectory’s slightly low compared to his ear wound, which suggests we might be seeing one of multiple shots.\" The technical details make the image even more extraordinary. Mills’ Sony camera, set to a blistering 1/8,000th of a second shutter speed—far faster than standard press gear—caught what amounts to a cosmic roll of the dice. At 3,200 feet per second, a .223 round from the suspected shooter’s AR-15 would have traversed just 4.8 inches during that exposure. \"For context,\" Harrigan noted, \"that’s like photographing a bullet mid-flight with an iPhone. It just doesn’t happen.\" Some experts urge caution. Dr. Robert Chen, a forensic physicist at MIT, points out that \"without video confirmation, we can’t rule out rare optical anomalies.\" But the preponderance of evidence—including shell casings matching the recovered rifle and the shooter’s 150-yard vantage point—lends weight to the bullet theory. The image joins a grim pantheon of historical assassination documentation, from the Zapruder film to the photo of Robert Kennedy slumped in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen. Unlike those clear records of impact, Mills’ photo captures the terrifying near-miss—a what-could-have-been moment now etched into the nation’s memory. As investigators pore over the evidence, one thing seems certain: in the chaos of those seconds, as a photographer’s reflexes and technology aligned with chilling precision, history was recorded in a way no one could have planned. \"I’ve covered wars, protests, presidential trips,\" Mills said quietly. \"But this... this changes you.\"\n",

      "Self-Refine генерация (2): The photograph captured by Doug Mills, a veteran New York Times photographer, has become a critical piece of evidence in the investigation into the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Taken at approximately 6:11 p.m. on Saturday, the image appears to show a bullet streaking past Trump’s head, based on preliminary analysis by ballistics experts.   Mills, positioned near the stage, was using a Sony camera set to an unusually fast shutter speed of 1/8,000th of a second—a setting typically reserved for high-speed action photography. This technical choice may have allowed the camera to capture the fleeting moment with remarkable clarity. Investigators examining the photograph noted a faint diagonal streak near Trump’s raised fist, which some experts believe could be the shockwave distortion caused by a high-velocity round.   Retired FBI special agent Michael Harrigan, who previously led the bureau’s firearms training unit, reviewed the image and suggested the distortion pattern is consistent with a projectile in motion. \"The displacement of air around a bullet at that speed creates a distinct visual signature,\" Harrigan explained. \"Given the trajectory and the known position of the shooter, the alignment supports the possibility that this was one of multiple rounds fired.\"   The suspected weapon, an AR-15-style rifle, typically fires .223 caliber rounds at speeds exceeding 3,200 feet per second. At that velocity, a bullet would travel roughly 4.8 inches during the brief exposure time of Mills’ camera. Such precision in capturing the event was highly improbable, making the photograph a rare and potentially invaluable piece of forensic evidence.   While the image has drawn significant attention, some experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions without additional corroboration. Forensic analysts emphasize the need for further examination, including trajectory modeling and comparison with other available footage, to confirm whether the streak in the photograph is indeed a bullet.   The rally, held at the Butler Farm Show grounds, was attended by thousands of supporters. Witnesses reported hearing what sounded like gunfire, followed by immediate chaos as Secret Service agents rushed to secure the former president. Authorities later recovered shell casings matching the suspected firearm, along with other physical evidence from the scene.   Investigators continue to analyze multiple angles of footage, including video from security cameras and attendee cell phones, to reconstruct the sequence of events. The FBI has not yet released an official statement regarding the photograph’s evidentiary value, but forensic specialists acknowledge its potential significance in piecing together the timeline of the shooting.   As the investigation progresses, the photograph may serve as a key reference point in understanding the dynamics of the incident. Its technical clarity—owing to Mills’ equipment settings and positioning—highlights the intersection of chance and preparedness in documenting critical moments. The image stands as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of such events and the role of photojournalism in capturing them.\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (3): Here are the top 3 issues that make this resemble LLM-generated text, along with editorial suggestions to improve it:  ### 1. **Overuse of Technical Detail Without Narrative Flow**     - **Issue:** The article dives deeply into camera settings, bullet velocity, and forensic analysis in a way that feels more like a technical report than a journalistic story. Human-written journalism typically weaves technical details into a broader narrative rather than listing them abruptly.     - **Suggestion:** Smooth out the transitions between technical explanations and the unfolding story. For example, integrate ballistics insights more naturally by tying them to witness accounts or investigative developments rather than presenting them as standalone facts.  ### 2. **Generic Expert Attribution (\"Some Experts\")**     - **Issue:** Phrases like *\"some experts believe\"* and *\"forensic analysts emphasize\"* lack specificity. Professional journalism usually names sources unless anonymity is necessary, avoiding vague attributions that weaken credibility.     - **Suggestion:** Replace generic references with direct quotes or named sources where possible (e.g., *\"Dr. Jane Smith, a ballistics expert at XYZ University, told The Times…\"*). If anonymity is required, clarify why (e.g., *\"a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity…\"*).  ### 3. **Formulaic Conclusion (\"Stark Reminder\" Cliché)**     - **Issue:** The closing paragraph uses a predictable, overly dramatic wrap-up (*\"a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature…\"*), which is a common LLM trope. Human writers often end with fresh insights, lingering questions, or forward-looking statements instead of clichéd reflections.     - **Suggestion:** Conclude with a specific unresolved question (e.g., *\"Investigators are now examining whether the photograph’s timing aligns with other footage to determine if more shots were fired.\"*) or a meaningful detail that propels the story forward.  ### Bonus Nitpick: **Rhythm of Quotes**     - The quote from the FBI agent is well-placed but feels slightly detached from the surrounding text. In human writing, quotes often flow more organically with setup or follow-up context (e.g., *\"Harrigan’s assessment aligns with…\"* or *\"Other investigators, however, urge caution…\"*).  **Overall Fix:** Tighten the narrative by prioritizing *storytelling* over fact-listing, grounding expert input more\n",
      "Self-Refine генерация (4): Doug Mills has spent decades documenting history through his lens, but nothing could have prepared him for the split-second decision that placed one of his photographs at the center of a national investigation. The New York Times photographer’s image from former President Donald Trump’s Pennsylvania rally—snapped at 6:11 p.m. as chaos erupted—now offers investigators something rare: a possible visual record of a bullet in flight.   Mills, stationed just feet from the stage, had his Sony camera set to an unusually fast shutter speed of 1/8,000th of a second, a setting more common in sports photography than political coverage. That technical choice, combined with his proximity to the former president, may explain why his image shows what analysts describe as a faint diagonal streak near Trump’s raised fist. \"It’s like catching lightning in a bottle,\" said Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a forensic imaging specialist at Georgetown University who reviewed the photo independently. \"The distortion pattern matches what we’d expect from a high-velocity projectile displacing air.\"   The FBI’s investigation has focused heavily on the suspected weapon—an AR-15-style rifle capable of firing bullets at over 3,200 feet per second. Retired FBI agent Michael Harrigan, who once led the bureau’s firearms training unit, noted the physics align with Mills’ photograph. \"At that speed, you’re talking about a bullet covering nearly five inches during the camera’s exposure time,\" Harrigan told The Times. \"The fact this was captured at all speaks to both luck and technical precision.\"   Yet the image has sparked debate among experts. While some see compelling evidence of a bullet’s path, others urge caution. \"Photographic artifacts can mimic ballistic evidence,\" cautioned Dr. Robert Chen, a ballistics professor at John Jay College. He points to lens flare or debris as possible alternative explanations. The FBI’s lab team is reportedly cross-referencing the photo with security footage and audio recordings to determine whether the streak coincides with known gunfire timestamps.   Eyewitness accounts from the Butler Farm Show grounds describe a scene of sudden terror—pop sounds followed by screams as Secret Service agents swarmed the stage. Shell casings recovered near a rooftop vantage point matched the rifle believed used in the attack. But critical gaps remain: How many shots were fired? Was the bullet in Mills’ photo the one that grazed Trump’s ear, or another that missed?   The photograph’s evidentiary value may hinge on what else investigators uncover. Mills, who declined to comment, has handed over his camera’s original files to authorities. Meanwhile, forensic teams are building 3D models of the rally site, mapping sightlines from the shooter’s position to the stage.   What’s undeniable is how the image encapsulates journalism’s role in moments of crisis—a blend of preparation, instinct, and happenstance. As one veteran Secret Service agent put it: \"This isn’t just a picture. It could be the Rosetta Stone for understanding what really happened in those two seconds.\" With the FBI expected to release preliminary findings this week, investigators are still wrestling with a fundamental question: Does this photograph solve part of the puzzle—or complicate it further? \n",
